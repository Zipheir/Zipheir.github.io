    <h2>Quotation</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://archive.org/details/feynman_lectures_on_computation">
      <p>Now, many years ago, I got interested in the generalization of such
      a problem: I wanted to figure out formulae for the sums of squares,
      cubes, and higher powers, trying to find the sum of <var>m</var>
      things each up to the <var>n</var>th power. And I cracked it,
      finding a whole lot of nice relations. …</p>

      <p>Anyway, I discovered later that these numbers had actually been
      discovered back in 1746. So I had made it up to 1746! They were
      called “Bernoulli Numbers”. … So I went through life like this,
      discovering next something that had first been discovered in 1889,
      then something from 1921 … and finally I discovered something that
      had the same date as when I discovered it. But I get so much fun out
      of doing it that I figure there must be others out there who do too,
      so I am giving you these problems to enjoy yourselves with. (Of
      course, everyone enjoys themselves in different ways.) I would just
      urge you not to be intimidated by them, nor put off by the fact that
      they’ve been done. You’re unlikely to discover something new without
      a lot of practice on old stuff, but further, you should get a heck
      of a lot of fun out of working out funny relations and interesting
      things. Also, if you read what the other fool did, you can
      appreciate how hard it was to do (or not), what he was trying to do,
      what his problems were, and so forth. It’s much easier to understand
      things after you’ve fiddled with them before you read the solution.
