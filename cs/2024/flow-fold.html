    <h2>Paragraph flowing as a fold</h2>

    <p>A simple, useful, plain-text variant of Donald Knuth’s
    paragraph-filling algorithm can be expressed as a fold. This algorithm
    runs in time linear to the length of its input and usually produces
    better results than the classic greedy text-flow algorithm.</p>

    <p>We first specify the function <code>flow-paragraph</code> and
    partially define its helpers:</p>

    <pre><code>(: flow-paragraph (→ (list Word) (list (list Word))))
{ flow-paragraph = build-lines ∘ flow }

(: flow (→ (list Word) (list Line-Info)))
(define (flow words)
  (match words
    (() ())
    ((,w . ,ws)
     (let ((ls (flow ws)))
       (cons (best-break w ls) ls)))))

(: build-lines (→ (list Line-Info) (list (list Word))))</code></pre>

    <p>where the types are given by</p>

    <pre><code>(define-type Word String)  ; but could be more complex

    (define-type Line-Info (list Word Offset Cost))</code></pre>

    <p>For simplicity, we represent a Word by its text as a String. The
    type could include more data, e.g. a string containing any following
    whitespace, or syntactic context information (does the word end with
    punctuation? Does it end a sentence? etc.). We will ignore syntax and
    assume that each word is followed by a single space.</p>

    <p>We will spend most of our time on <code>flow</code>, which expresses
    the algorithm by taking a list of words to a list of values which indicate
    the “best” way to break a line beginning with a given word. To see how
    this data is encoded, consider the line</p>

    <pre><code>"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,".</code></pre>

    <p>This is represented by the Word list</p>

    <pre><code>("It" "was" "the" "best" "of" "times," "it" "was" "the"
 "worst" "of" "times,")</code></pre>

    <p>If we were trying to break this into lines of about 25 characters, the
    optimal first line might be <code>"It was the best of times,",</code>
    which would be encoded by the triple <code>("It" 5 c).</code>

    <p>The interpretation: This is a line consisting of the word
    <code>"It"</code> followed by 5 words taken from the
    paragraph-suffix (<code>"was the worst of times,"</code>).
    <var>c</var> is a positive integer indicating the relative quality
    (“badness”, in TeX terminology) of this line break—the lower the
    cost, the better the choice.</p>

    <p>The Flow algorithm flows a paragraph
    <code>(</code><var>w</var> <code>.</code> <var>ws</var><code>)</code>
    by finding the best line beginning with <var>w</var> that <em>also</em>
    results in the best flow for the suffix <var>ws</var>. This is
    crucially different from the greedy algorithm, which makes only local
    choices; it may find a very nice break for <var>w</var>’s line at the
    cost of choosing awful breaks for the rest of the paragraph.</p>

    <p>Those familiar with the list folds will immediately recognize a
    right fold in the equations for <code>flow</code>:</p>

    <pre><code>(define (flow ws)
  (fold-right (λ (w ls)
                (cons (best-break w ls) ls))
              '()
              ws))</code></pre>

    <p>We need a definition for <code>best-break</code>, which returns a
    Line-Info
    structure describing the best way to break the line beginning with
    word <var>w</var>. If we can enumerate all legal ways of breaking
    after <var>w</var>, then it should suffice to choose the minimum-cost
    solution [TODO: more here about the retention of break data for the
    entire suffix]:</p>

    <pre><code>;; (: best-break (→ Word (list Line-Info) (list Line-Info)))
(define (best-break w ls)
  (minimum-cost
   (enumerate-breaks (cons (word-&gt;line-info w) ls))))

;; (: minimum-cost (→ (list Line-Info) Line-Info))
(define (minimum-cost ls)
  (minimum-by (λ (l1 l2)
                (&lt; (cost l1) (cost l2)))
              ls)

;; (: word-&gt;line-info (→ Word Line-Info))
(define (word-&gt;line-info w) (list w 1 0))</code></pre>

    <p><code>word-&gt;line-info</code> constructs a singleton line, i.e.
    one consisting of a single word. Adding this to the paragraph suffix
    avoids some inelegance during length computation. We do not use the
    cost associated with this sentinel value.</p>

    <pre><code>;; (: enumerate-breaks (→ (list Line-Info) (list Line-Info)))
(define (enumerate-breaks suffix)
  (assert (pair? suffix))
  (line-candidates 0 0 suffix))

;; (: line-candidates (→ ℕ Offset (list Line-Info) (list Line-Info)))
(define (line-candidates len run-len suffix)
  (match suffix
    ((,_)             ; last word of paragraph
     `((,run-len 0)))
    (((,w ,_ ,cost) . ,suffix*)
     (if (&gt;= len longest-allowed-line)
         '()          ; halt
         (cons (list run-len (+ cost (length-cost len)))
               (let ((len* (+ len space-length (word-length w))))
                 (line-candidates len* (+ run-len 1) suffix*)))))))</code></pre>

    <p>The helper function <code>line-candidates</code> is the most
    complex part of the entire algorithm. It traverses a prefix of
    <var>suffix</var>, extending the previous break by one word at each
    step, until it hits the maximum line length. The list of candidate
    breaks is returned.</p>

    <p>A few explanations are in order. The last line of a paragraph is
    always assigned a cost of 0, since it’s customary to allows these
    lines to be very short. This is handled by the first, singleton case
    of <code>line-candidates</code>. <code>space-length</code>—a constant
    equal to 1 in this version of the algorithm—is added to the length of
    each candidate; this is the number of spaces following the current word.
    (These are deliberate simplifications. See the Enhancements section for
    discussion.)</p>

    <p><code>length-cost</code> computes the cost of a line as a function
    of the square of the difference between its length and the goal
    length:</p>

    <pre><code>;; (: length-cost (→ ℕ Cost))
(define (length-cost len)
  (short-cost (- goal-length len)))

;; (: short-cost (→ Integer Cost))
(define (short-cost z)
  (expt (* z 10) 2))</code></pre>

    <p>(In GNU fmt, the goal length is 7% less than the maximum allowed
    width.)</p>

    <p>Much more complex heuristics could be used to compute the cost of
    a line, but the version of <code>length-cost</code> above is simple
    and pretty good in practice.</p>

    <p>An elegant fact about the <code>line-candidates</code> fold is
    that the number of words it must examine to find the optimal way of
    breaking a given line is bounded by <code>longest-allowed-line</code>
    / 2. To see this, consider a maximally “fine” (as opposed to “coarse”)
    paragraph made up of one-character words, e.g.</p>

    <blockquote><p>A B C D E F G …</p></blockquote>

    <p><code>line-candidates</code> will produce many candidates
    for a suffix of such a paragraph, because the cumulative
    length will approach longest-allowed-line slowly. How
    slowly? At a rate of 1 + <code>space-length</code> per
    word. For normal prose <code>space-constant</code> ≥ 1, so the
    <code>line-candidates</code> process will terminate after producing at
    most <code>longest-allowed-line</code> / 2 candidates.</p>

    <p><code>line-candidates</code> thus runs in O(1) time. And since the
    rest of
    the algorithm simply processes the candidates produced by this function,
    it seems likely that <code>flow-paragraph</code> runs in time linear
    in the length of its input.</p>
