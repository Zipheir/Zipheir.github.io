<h1>Part 1</h1>

<p>Scan a list of positive integers and give the number of times an
integer was greater than the previous one.</p>

<p>Ignoring input, this is a function [ℕ] → ℕ, so it is clearly
expressible as some sort of fold.</p>

<p>We could express it recursively by</p>

<pre><code>depth_changes : [ℕ] → ℕ
depth_changes []            = 0
depth_changes [_]           = 0
depth_changes (x ∷ x′ ∷ xs) = if x &lt; x&rsquo;;
                                then 1 + (depth_changes xs);
                                else depth_changes xs
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly we&rsquo;re pairing up each element with its successor, so why
not factor this as some function count_changes : [(ℕ × ℕ)] → ℕ
after a zip?</p>

<pre><code>
depth_changes xs = count_changes (zip xs (tail xs))
</code></pre>

<p>The recursive equations for count_changes are straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>count_changes []            = 0
count_changes (⟨m, n⟩ ∷ ps) = if m &lt; n;
                                then 1 + count_changes ps
                                else count_changes ps
</code></pre>

<p>This gives the following left fold:</p>

<pre><code>count_changes = foldl f 0

f c ⟨m, n⟩ = if m &lt; n then c + 1 else c
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, we could write this as a tupled fold.  The base
value could include the first number of the list to avoid introducing
a spurious change, but here we take a slightly dumber approach: just
subtract 1 from the result.</p>

<pre><code>depth_changes ns = (fst (foldl compare ⟨0, 0⟩ ns)) - 1

compare : (ℕ × ℕ) → ℕ → (ℕ × ℕ)
compare ⟨c, m⟩ n = if m &lt; n; then (c + 1, n); else (c, n)
</code></pre>

<p>I think I prefer the zipped version, which decomposes the problem
nicely.</p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p>Now we want to compute the number of times the sum over a sliding
window increases.  In the following example, we compare the sum over
the "A window" with the sum over the B window, and so on.</p>

<pre><code>
199  A
200  A B
208  A B C
210    B C D
200  E   C D
207  E F   D
240  E F G
269    F G H
260      G H
263        H
</code></pre>

<p>The sums over two consecutive windows are always given by</p>

<pre><code>w1 = x1 + x2 + x3
w2 = x2 + x3 + x4
</code></pre>

<p>and thus w1 &lt; w2 iff x1 &lt; x4.  So we can avoid repetitive summing by
reading the list in groups of four and comparing the first and last
element of each group.</p>

<p>The following reflects an inaccurate understanding of the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
We can express this by window_changes = count compare_w ∘ chunks 4
where chunks divides a list into sublists of length ≤ 4.
</blockquote>

<p>This gives a much lower answer for test input, because these windows
aren&rsquo;t sliding!  Using this strategy, you get this variation on the
above diagram:</p>

<pre><code>
199  A
200  A B
208  A B
210    B
200  C
207  C D
240  C D
269    D
260  E
263  E F
...
</code></pre>

<p>We can devise a &ldquo;sliding&rdquo; list-chunker which gives successive
sublists; e.g.</p>

<pre><code>windows 3 [a, b, c, d, e]
    = [[a, b, c], [b, c, d], [c, d, e]]
</code></pre>

<p>This can be specified by the recursive equation</p>

<pre><code>windows k []        = []
windows k (x ∷ xs′) = take k (x ∷ xs′) ∷ windows k xs′
</code></pre>

<p>Since the second equation depends on xs′, windows cannot be
defined directly as a catamorphism.  It&rsquo;s more interesting to
define it as an anamorphism:</p>

<pre><code>windows k = unfoldr (frame k)

frame : Int → [α] → Maybe ([α], [α])
frame _ []       = Nothing
frame k (x : xs) = Just (take k (x : xs), xs)
</code></pre>

<p>So we can express all of the &ldquo;frame overlaps&rdquo; of interest by</p>

<pre><code>filter length_four ∘ windows 4
</code></pre>

<p>Then it&rsquo;s a matter of counting the increasing sums:</p>

<pre><code>count compare_w ∘ filter length_four ∘ windows 4
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<pre><code>count : (a → Bool) → [a] → ℕ;
count p ≡ length ∘ filter p
</code></pre>

<p>which can be expressed easily as the catamorphism</p>

<pre><code>count p = foldl (λc x → if p x; then c + 1; else c) 0
</code></pre>

<p>This produces the right answer, but since we have a hylomorphism, it
would be nice to &ldquo;deforest&rdquo; it through fusion.  The first step is to
fuse the count and filter; instead of using cata fusion, though, we
simply combine the predicates compare_w and length_four&ndash;since, in
fact, the domain of compare_w is restricted to length-four lists,
anyway:</p>

<pre><code>
increasing : [ℕ] → Bool
increasing ns = (length ns == 4) ∧ (ns !! 0 &lt; ns !! 3)
</code></pre>

<p>So now the hylomorphism is clear.  We have the hylo operator for
single-argument unfold as</p>

<pre><code>
hylo : (α → β → β) → β → (γ → Maybe (α, γ)) → γ → β
hylo f e g b = case g b of {
                 Nothing → e;
                 Just (x, b′) → f x (hylo f e g b′) }
</code></pre>

<p>characterized by</p>

<pre><code>
h = hylo f e g b ⇔ h = foldr f e . unfoldr g b
</code></pre>

<p>Thus</p>

<pre><code>
  depth_changes

=   { result above }

  count increasing ∘ windows 4

=   { count def., switching to foldr (first duality theorem) }

  foldr (λc ns → if increasing ns; then c + 1; else c) 0 ∘ windows 4

=   { windows def. }

  foldr (λc ns → if increasing ns; then c + 1; else c) 0
    ∘ unfoldr (frame k)

=   { hylo u.p. }

  hylo (λc ns → if increasing ns; then c + 1; else c)
       0
       (frame k)
</code></pre>

<p>where the base element b is the list argument.  We can actually
generalize this as a "counting" hylo which counts the number of
notionally-constructed type that satisfy a given predicate:</p>

<pre><code>
count_hylo p g b = hylo (λc x → if p x; then c + 1; else c) 0 g b
</code></pre>

<p>Then we have</p>

<pre><code>
depth_changes = count_hylo increasing (frame k)
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty compact.  It does use space bounded by 4n for an input
n-list, and clearly there are going to be list-scanning solutions
which use constant space.  It&rsquo;s worth considering how we could derive
those.</p>
