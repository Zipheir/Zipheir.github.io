<h1>Part 1</h1>

<p>We are given a &ldquo;report&rdquo; consisting of a list of fixed-length
bitstrings and are asked to compute the &ldquo;gamma rate&rdquo; and &ldquo;epsilon
rate&rdquo; as follows.  The first of these numbers is found by
concatenating the most common bits in each position over all the
bitstrings; the second, by concatenating the least common bits.</p>

<p>This is an interesting one.  The first approach that comes to mind
is simple counting.  The simplest case is for determining the most
common bit of &ldquo;single column&rdquo; input—i.e. a list of bits:</p>

<pre><code>mcb : [ℕ] → ℕ
mcb bs = let { ⟨k, m⟩ = count_bits bs } in
           if k ≤ m then 0; else 1

count_bits : [ℕ] → (ℕ × ℕ)
count_bits = foldl (λ ⟨k, m⟩ b → if b == 0
                                    then ⟨k + 1, m⟩
                                    else ⟨k, m + 1⟩)
                   ⟨0, 0⟩
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s a run-of-the-mill induction to show that <em>mcb</em> gives us the most
common bit for a list of bits.  Now we want a version which can handle
k-bitstrings.  We specify this in terms of a variant of <em>count_bits</em>:</p>

<pre><code>-- Specialized to position k
bpₖ : [[ℕ]] → (ℕ × ℕ)
bpₖ = foldr (λ bs ⟨m, n⟩ →
                if (bs !! k) == 0
                   then ⟨m + 1, n⟩
                   else ⟨m, n + 1⟩)
             ⟨0, 0⟩

cbs : [[ℕ]] → ⟨ℕ, ℕ, …⟩
cbs bss = let { ⟨p₁, p₂, …, pₖ⟩ = ⟨bp₀ bss, …, bpₖ bss⟩
                com ⟨m, n⟩      = if m ≤ n then 0 else 1 }
            in ⟨com p₁, com p₂, …, com pₖ⟩
</code></pre>

<p>The heart of <em>cbs</em> is the split, ⟨<em>bp</em>₀, …, <em>bp</em>ₖ⟩, of type
[[ℕ]] → ((ℕ × ℕ) × ⋯ × (ℕ × ℕ)).  This applies <em>bp</em> for each position
to compute the number of occurrences of each bit.  This is
specification; as an algorithm, it involves traversing the input k
times.  Converting this to a single traversal is an application of the
k-ary banana split theorem (see Fokkinga 1991 or many books on
functional programming from the Richard Bird/Phil Wadler sphere of
influence), which states that</p>

<pre><code>⟨⦇h₁⦈, …, ⦇hₖ⦈⟩ = ⦇⟨h₁ ∘ F π₁, …, hₖ ∘ F πₖ⟩⦈
</code></pre>

<p>where the πs are the projections for a k-ary product.
The type functor in question (underlying [[ℕ]]) is given on objects
and arrows by:</p>

<pre><code>F A = 1 + ([ℕ] × A)
F f = id + (id × f)
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding each <em>bp</em>ᵢ as a catamorphism with &ldquo;gene&rdquo; <em>h</em>ᵢ, we have:</p>

<pre><code>  ⟨bp₀, …, bpₖ⟩
= ⟨⦇h₁⦈, …, ⦇hₖ⦈⟩
= ⦇⟨h₁ ∘ F π₁, …, hₖ ∘ F πₖ⟩⦈
= ⦇⟨h₁ ∘ (id + (id × π₁)), …, hₖ ∘ F (id + (id × πₖ))⟩⦈
</code></pre>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have to write out the gene <em>h</em>ᵢ in point-free form to
know that it is of the form [const ⟨0, 0⟩, fᵢ] (the <em>bp</em>ᵢ differ only
in their &ldquo;inductive case combinator&rdquo;).  Absorbing all of the
coproducts in the expression above thus gives:</p>

<pre><code>= ⦇⟨ [const ⟨0, 0⟩, f₁ ∘ (id × π₁)], …,
     [const ⟨0, 0⟩, fₖ ∘ (id × πₖ)] ⟩⦈
</code></pre>

<p>The usual tactic when applying banana split is now to use the exchange
law to convert the &ldquo;split&rdquo; gene to an &ldquo;either&rdquo; gene, thus putting the
catamorphism into a form that follows the type&rsquo;s underlying bifunctor.
That&rsquo;s indeed the next step; we obtain:</p>

<pre><code>= ⦇[⟨const ⟨0, 0⟩, …, const ⟨0, 0⟩⟩,
    ⟨f₁ ∘ (id × π₁), …, fₖ ∘ (id × πₖ)⟩]⦈
</code></pre>

<p>This catamorphism has type [[ℕ]] → ((ℕ × ℕ) × ⋯ × (ℕ × ℕ)).  Each <em>f</em>ᵢ
has type ([ℕ] × ((ℕ × ℕ) × ⋯ × (ℕ × ℕ))) → (ℕ × ℕ), and can be given
in point-wise terms as follows:</p>

<pre><code>fᵢ (bs, v) = let { ⟨m, n⟩ = πᵢ v } in
               if (bs !! i) == 0
                  then ⟨m + 1, n⟩
                  else ⟨m, n + 1⟩
</code></pre>

<p>Expressing the whole thing as a point-wise fold is now easy.  We use
a variant of <em>f</em>₁ called <em>count_pos</em> which abstracts over the index:</p>

<pre><code>bp_all : [[ℕ]] → ((ℕ × ℕ) × ⋯ × (ℕ × ℕ))
bp_all = foldr ⟨count_pos 0, …, count_pos k⟩
               ⟨⟨0, 0⟩, …, ⟨0, 0⟩⟩

count_pos : ℕ → [ℕ] → ((ℕ × ℕ) × ⋯ × (ℕ × ℕ)) → (ℕ × ℕ)
count_pos i bs v = let { ⟨m, n⟩ = v !! i } in
                     if (bs !! i) == 0
                        then ⟨m + 1, n⟩
                        else ⟨m, n + 1⟩
</code></pre>

<p>In most programming languages, we&rsquo;ll have to use some kind of vector
(rather than kosher tuple) type to implement <em>count_pos</em>.  We&rsquo;ll use
that here to present the entire program for the 5-word case, lazily
assuming we can treat k-vectors and k-tuples as the same type:</p>

<pre><code>bp_all : [[ℕ]] → Vector 5 (ℕ × ℕ)
bp_all = foldr ⟨add_pos 0, add_pos 1, add_pos 2, add_pos 3,
                add_pos 4⟩
               (make_vector 5 ⟨0, 0⟩)

add_pos : ℕ → [ℕ] → Vector 5 (ℕ × ℕ) → (ℕ × ℕ)
add_pos i bs v = let { ⟨m, n⟩ = v !! i } in
                   if (bs !! i) == 0
                      then ⟨m + 1, n⟩
                      else ⟨m, n + 1⟩

cbs : [[ℕ]] → Vector 5 ℕ
cbs bss = let { ⟨p₀, p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄⟩ = bp_all bss
                com ⟨m, n⟩      = if m ≤ n then 0 else 1 }
            in ⟨com p₀, com p₁, com p₂, comp p₃, com p₄⟩
</code></pre>

<p>The repetitive indexed names can be eliminated by replacing the split
of <em>count_pos i</em> by a vector traversal.  The specification is just</p>

<pre><code>add_all_pos : [ℕ] → Vector k (ℕ × ℕ) → Vector k (ℕ × ℕ)
add_all_pos bs v = ⟨add_pos 0 bs v, …, add_pos k bs v⟩
</code></pre>

<p>For dealing with the realities of an array type, we may want to adapt
<em>add_all_pos</em> to take a single pair instead of the entire array.</p>

<p>In addition to this simplification, we&rsquo;d also want to replace <em>foldr</em>
with a strict left fold; we can make this replacement thanks to the
second fold duality theorem (right, er, left as an exercise).</p>

<h1>Part 2</h1>

<p>(Note: In this part, bitstrings are referred to as words, and Word
is used as a type synonym for [ℕ].)</p>

<p>To search for the solution values of this part, we have to
progressively refine our collection of words according to certain
criteria, evaluated at successive positions in the words.  Each of
the two criteria requires us to find the most common bit in the
current position among the remaining words:</p>

<blockquote><p>To find oxygen generator rating, determine the most common value
(0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with
that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep
values with a 1 in the position being considered.</p>

<p>To find CO2 scrubber rating, determine the least common value
(0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with
that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep
values with a 0 in the position being considered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way to tackle this is to see it in terms of function iteration,
in which the wordlist is recursively refined until we have a singleton
list.  However, this involves lots of list index bookkeeping.  A
simpler approach is to think of these functions as building the rating
value up a bit at a time.</p>

<p>Each time we determine the most common bit for a position, we learn
which bit will be in that position in the final rating.  Since we
proceed from left to right, we only need consider the first bit of
all the words at each step:</p>

<pre><code>Index 0
       ↓
Words: 0 0 1 0 0
       1 1 1 1 0
       1 0 1 1 0
       ...

Most common bit: 1

--------

Index 1:
       ↓
Words: 1 1 1 0
       0 1 1 0
       ...

Most common bit: 0

--------

Index 2:
       ↓
Words: 1 1 0
       ...

Most common bit: 1
</code></pre>

<p>And so on.  Here&rsquo;s the specification:</p>

<pre><code>oxygen_rating : [Word] → Word
oxygen_rating ws =
  if null (head ws)
     then []
     else
       let { b = com 0 ws } in
         b ∷ build_rating (reduce b ws)

reduce : ℕ → [Word] → [Word]
reduce b = fmap tail ∘ filter (λ(c:_) → b == c)
</code></pre>

<p>We use <em>null</em> ∘ <em>head</em> as our termination condition, since the words
are all of the same length.  The <em>reduce</em> function filters for words
with the correct bit, then takes the tail of all of them.</p>

<p><em>com i ws</em> is a function that gives the most common bit in position
<em>i</em> in the list <em>ws</em>, breaking ties in favor of 1.</p>

<p>Clearly this is a list unfold (anamorphism).  We use Gibbons&rsquo;s version
of the unfold universal property:</p>

<pre><code>h = unfold p f g
  ⇔
h b = if p b then [] else (f b) ∷ (h (g b))
</code></pre>

<p>Applying this to the above gives</p>

<pre><code>p = null ∘ head
f = com 0
g = λws → reduce (com 0 ws) ws
</code></pre>

<p>Computing <em>com 0 ws</em> twice is wasteful; this is an excellent use for
&ldquo;single-function unfold&rdquo; (called <em>unfoldr</em> in Haskell).</p>

<pre><code>oxygen_rating = unfoldr gen_and_filter

gen_and_filter : [Word] → Maybe (ℕ × [Word])
gen_and_filter ([] ∷ _) = Nothing
gen_and_filter ws       = let { b = com 0 ws } in
                            Just ⟨b, reduce b ws⟩
</code></pre>

<p>This works for computing the oxygen rating, but we get an interesting
bug when trying to adapt it to find the scrubber rating:</p>

<pre><code>scrubber_rating = unfoldr gen_and_filter′

gen_and_filter′ : [Word] → Maybe (ℕ × [Word])
gen_and_filter′ ([] ∷ _) = Nothing
gen_and_filter′ ws       = let { b = bit_flip (com 0 ws) } in
                            Just ⟨b, reduce b ws⟩
</code></pre>

<p>This goes off the rails and creates an infinite list.  Why?  We end up
filtering out the last word in the list, because now we&rsquo;re keeping only
those (sub)words that begin with the <em>least common</em> bit.</p>

<pre><code>reduce 0 [[1,0]] ⇒ []
</code></pre>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a problem with <em>oxygen_rating</em>, since filtering for the
words with the most common bit in head position will leave a singleton
list unchanged:</p>

<pre><code>reduce 1 [[1,0]] ⇒ [[1,0]]
</code></pre>

<p>This makes me think that the recursive refinement approach might be
preferable, after all—we need that final word!  But we can fix
<em>scrubber_rating</em> by generalizing to an apomorphism, which allows
us to tack a &ldquo;tail&rdquo; onto the unfolded list.  Here&rsquo;s the <em>apo</em>
function (based on Gibbons 2003):</p>

<pre><code>apo : (β → Maybe (α × (β + [α]))) → β → [α]
apo f b = case f b of
            Nothing            → []
            Just (x, Left v)   → x ∷ (apo f v)
            Just (x, Right xs) → xs ∷ xs
</code></pre>

<p>We then have:</p>

<pre><code>scrubber_rating = apo gen_and_filter″

gen_and_filter″ : [Word] → Maybe (ℕ × ([Word] + Word))
gen_and_filter″ ([] ∷ _)        = Nothing
gen_and_filter″ ((b ∷ bs) ∷ []) = Just (b, Right bs)
gen_and_filter″ ws              =
  let { b = bit_flip (com 0 ws) } in
    Just ⟨b, Left (reduce b ws)⟩
</code></pre>

<p>All that&rsquo;s left is to convert the words to decimal numbers and to
multiply them.</p>
