<h1>Part 1</h1>

<p>Today we&rsquo;re given a 2-D matrix of natural numbers (a heightmap) and
must first find the &ldquo;low points&rdquo;.  A low point is defined to be an
entry which is less than each of its four row-and-column neighbors.</p>

<p>Our &ldquo;map&rdquo; will thus support a 2-D notion of indexing, as well as a
map from each index to its neighbors:</p>

<pre><code>∀ m, n : ℕ → Height_Map (m, n) ≅ [(i, j) | i ← [0..m-1], j ← [0..n-1]]

elem_at : Height_Map (m, n) → (ℕ × ℕ) → ℕ

neighbors : Height_Map (m, n) → (ℕ × ℕ) → [ℕ]
</code></pre>

<p>For simplicity, we assume all indices are within bounds.</p>

<p><em>neighbors</em> gives the neighbors of the element at <em>i</em>, <em>j</em> in Height_Map;
its value will be a list of two, three, or four numbers, depending
on where <em>i</em>, <em>j</em> is in the map (corner elements have only two neighbors,
etc.).  We assume indices are row-major:</p>

<pre><code>neighbors hm = list (elem_at hm) ∘ neighbor_ixs (bounds hm)

neighbor_ixs : (ℕ × ℕ) → (ℕ × ℕ) → [(ℕ × ℕ)]
neighbor_ixs (m, n) (r, c) =
  filter (≠ (r, c))
    (nub [(r ∸ 1, c), (r, c ∸ 1), (r, min (c + 1) n),
         (min (r + 1) m, c)])
</code></pre>

<p><em>neighbor_ixs</em> is a little tedious.  ∸ here is natural
number subtraction (AKA &ldquo;monus&rdquo;), which returns zero if the first
argument is less than the second.  <em>nub</em> : Eq α → [α] → [α] is a
library function which removes duplicate equal elements from a list.</p>

<p>We can now specify a function that produces the low points of a
Height_Map.</p>

<pre><code>low : Height_Map (m, n) → (ℕ × ℕ) → Bool
low hm (i, j) =
  let (e, ns) = (elem_at hm (i, j), neighbors hm (i, j)) in
    all (λ n → e &lt; n) ns

low_points : Height_Map (m, n) → [ℕ × ℕ]
low_points hm = [ (i, j) | i ← [0..m-1],
                           j ← [0..n-1],
                           low hm (i, j) ]

low_point_heights hm = list (elem_at hm) ∘ low_points hm
</code></pre>

<p>The rest is easy.  We want the sum of the &ldquo;risk levels&rdquo; of the low
points:</p>

<pre><code>risk : ℕ → ℕ
risk n = n + 1
</code></pre>

<p>The whole thing is thus</p>

<pre><code>sum ∘ list risk ∘ low_points_heights
</code></pre>

<p>As usual, this can be fused into a single traversal, but it doesn&rsquo;t
seem worth the trouble.</p>

<h1>Part 2</h1>

<p>Now things get much more interesting.  We want to find <em>basins</em>; a
basin is described informally as a collection of &ldquo;all locations
that eventually flow downward to a single low point&rdquo;.  Locations of
height 9 are not included in any basin.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try to come up with a more formal definition.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Each low point is in a basin.</p></li>
<li><p>If a point <em>p</em> is in a basin, then so is each neighbor <em>q</em> of
<em>p</em> satisfying</p>

<ul>
<li><em>q</em> has height 8 or less.</li>
<li>The height of <em>q</em> is greater than the height of <em>p</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>This immediately suggests an algorithm for finding the basin associated
with a low point <em>p</em>.  We can see each location as a node of a graph
with four edges linking it to its neighbors; to find a basin, we begin
with just a low point, add the neighboring nodes that satisfy the above
conditions, then recurse on each neighbor.</p>

<p>This allows us to construct a tree (specifically, a rose tree)
describing a basin.  Each node associates a location in the basin with
its &ldquo;watershed&rdquo; (the node&rsquo;s children), so we can think of this as a
model of the basin&rsquo;s &ldquo;flow&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code>data Rose α   = Node α (Forest α)
data Forest α = [Rose α]

basin_flow : Height_Map (m, n) → (ℕ × ℕ) → Rose (ℕ × ℕ)
basin_flow hm (i, j) =
  let h          = elem_at hm (i, j)
      ns         = neighbor_ixs (m, n) (i, j)
    in Node (i, j)
            (Forest (list (basin_flow hm)
                          (filter (inb h ∘ elem_at hm) ns)))

inb : ℕ → ℕ → Bool
inb h k = k ≠ 9 ∧ k &gt; h
</code></pre>

<p>Rose trees have the following mutually-recursive pairs of fold and
unfold functions (from Gibbons 2003):</p>

<pre><code>foldR : (α → γ → β) → ([β] → γ) → Rose α → β
foldR f g (Node x ts) = f x (foldF f g ts)

foldF : (α → γ → β) → ([β] → γ) → Forest α → γ
foldF f g = g ∘ list (foldR f g)

unfoldR : (β → α) → (β → [β]) → β → Rose α
unfoldR f g x = Node (f x) (unfoldF f g x)

unfoldF : (β → α) → (β → [β]) → β → Forest α
unfoldF f g = list (unfoldR f g) ∘ g
</code></pre>

<p>Reworking <em>basin_flow</em> slightly, we can express it as a rose tree
unfold:</p>

<pre><code>basin_flow : Height_Map (m, n) → (ℕ × ℕ) → Rose (ℕ × ℕ)
basin_flow hm = unfoldR id (expand hm)

expand : Height_Map (m, n) → ((ℕ × ℕ) → [(ℕ × ℕ)])
expand hm (i, j) =
  let h = elem_at hm (i, j) in
    [ (k, l) | (k, l) ← neighbor_ixs (m, n) (i, j),
               inb h (elem_at hm (k, l)) ]
</code></pre>

<p>Note the use of use of curried application here to keep the
height map separate from the unfold.  All of the details here are
in <em>expand</em>, which expands the basin by a step, that is, it generates
the surrounding set of basin locations for a given point.</p>

<p>Every low point in our map is part of exactly one basin (since two
basins sharing the same low point would be contiguous at that low
point, and hence we&rsquo;d have only one basin).  Thus, we can express the
list of all basins in our map by:</p>

<pre><code>basins hm = list (nub ∘ flatten ∘ basin_flow hm) (low_points hm)

flatten : Rose α → [α]
flatten = foldR (∷) concat
</code></pre>

<p>The library function <em>nub</em> : [α] → [α] is used to remove duplicate
nodes, which can be introduced by our method for finding basins; it
may happen that two nodes share the same neighbor, which is of greater
height than both.</p>

<p>The list of sizes is then</p>

<pre><code>basin_sizes hm = list length (basins hm)
</code></pre>

<p>Using the functor properties of <em>list</em>, this becomes</p>

<pre><code>basin_sizes hm = list (length ∘ nub ∘ flatten ∘ basin_flow hm)
                      (low_points hm)
</code></pre>

<p>In practice, this definition is quite efficient enough for solving the
current puzzle.  However, let&rsquo;s improve it.  As many have probably
already seen, we don&rsquo;t need to construct the intermediate &ldquo;flow trees&rdquo;
at all.  Using a quick calculation, we derive a hylomorphism operator
for rose trees that allows us to &ldquo;deforest&rdquo; our algorithm.</p>

<p>We specify:</p>

<pre><code>hyloR :: (α → γ → δ) → ([δ] → γ) → (β → α) → (β → [β]) → β → δ
hyloR f g h l = foldR f g ∘ unfoldR h l
</code></pre>

<p>The calculation is straightforward.  For all x : β,</p>

<pre><code>  hyloR f g h l x

=  { specification }

  foldR f g (unfoldR h l x)

=  { unfoldR.1 }

  foldR f g (Node (h x) (unfoldF h l x))

=  { foldR.1 }

  f (h x) (foldF f g (unfoldF h l x))

=  { specify: hyloF f g h l = foldF f g ∘ unfoldF h l }

  f (h x) (hyloF f g h l x)
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, <em>hyloR</em> is one of a pair of mutually-recursive functions.
Now we calculate its Forest counterpart, <em>hyloF</em>:</p>

<pre><code>  hyloF f g h l x

=  { specification }

  foldF f g (unfoldF h l x)

=  { unfoldF.1 }

  foldF f g (list (unfoldR h l) (l x))

=  { foldF.1 }

  g (list (foldR f g) (list (unfoldR h l) (l x)))

=  { functor property of list }

  g (list (foldR f g ∘ unfoldR h l) (l x))

=  { specification of hyloR }

  g (list (hyloR f g h l) (l x))
</code></pre>

<p>This completes the derivation of <em>hyloR</em> and <em>hyloF</em>.</p>

<p>Since for all <em>hm</em> : Height_Map (m, n) we have,</p>

<pre><code>flatten ∘ basin_flow hm = foldR (∷) concat ∘ unfoldR id (expand hm)
</code></pre>

<p>we now redefine</p>

<pre><code>basin_sizes hm = list (length ∘ nub ∘ enum_basins hm)
                      (low_points hm)

enum_basins : Height_Map (m, n) → (ℕ × ℕ) → [(ℕ × ℕ)]
enum_basins hm = hyloR (∷) concat id (expand hm)
</code></pre>

<p><em>enum_basins</em> is thus a function which, given a low point, produces
the list of the coordinates of the surrounding basin.</p>

<p>A further set of calculations would allow us to fuse <em>length</em>, <em>nub</em>,
and <em>enum_basins</em>, eliminating the intermediate lists, as well.  The
fusion of <em>length</em> and <em>nub</em> doesn&rsquo;t produce a significant improvement,
however, and fusing the resulting list catamorphism with the rose tree
hylomorphism <em>enum_basins</em> requires quite a bit more work.  We&rsquo;ve
eliminated the trees, so, for now, we&rsquo;ll call this enough.</p>

<p>The rest of the puzzle is bookkeeping.  We want to know the product of
the sizes of the three largest basins:</p>

<pre><code>three_biggest = take 3 ∘ sort_decreasing

solution hm = product ∘ three_biggest ∘ basin_sizes hm
</code></pre>
