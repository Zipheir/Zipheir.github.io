<h1>Part 1</h1>

<p>We are building a lanternfish simulator.  Each lanternfish is a
little discrete automaton which reproduces under certain conditions.
We have a whole collection of them, and each &ldquo;day&rdquo; is a step for all
the lanternfish.  At the moment, the only thing that characterizes a
fish is its &ldquo;internal timer&rdquo;, a natural number between 0 and 8 which
tells us how many days we have until the fish reproduces:</p>

<pre><code>type Fish = ℕ

school_day : [Fish] → [Fish]
</code></pre>

<p><em>school_day</em> steps a list of fish (i.e. their counters), adding any
newly-spawned ones.  Since an individual fish can reproduce, the
<em>day</em> function takes a single fish to either one or two fish (&ldquo;chain&rdquo;
reproductions can&rsquo;t occur, since new lanternfish start at the maximum
timer count).  For convenience, we use a list instead of a sum:</p>

<pre><code>day : Fish → [Fish]
</code></pre>

<p>We then define</p>

<pre><code>school_day = concat ∘ List day
</code></pre>

<p>Enthusiasts will recognize the list monad; we&rsquo;ll remember this detail
for when things get more complicated in Part 2.  We want to be able
to run our simulation for a given number of days; this is a classic
function-power application,</p>

<pre><code>run_days : ℕ → [Fish] → [Fish]
run_days n = power n school_day
</code></pre>

<p>where <em>power n f</em> = <em>fⁿ</em>.</p>

<p>All that remains is to write <em>day</em>, which is just a matter of
transcribing the informal semantics we&rsquo;re given.</p>

<pre><code>day 0        = [6, 8]     -- reset, spawn
day (Succ n) = [n]
</code></pre>

<p>The population size after 80 steps is given by</p>

<pre><code>length ∘ run_days 80
</code></pre>

<h1>Part 2</h1>

<p>Rather than giving us a more interesting system to simulate, Wastl
has decided to try to melt our hardware.  I&rsquo;m disappointed, but it
did give an opportunity to think about how to represent this
simple-but-enormous situation.</p>

<p>Running the simulation of even the five-fish example for 256 days
will give us billions of fish, so we clearly can&rsquo;t simulate the
school in O(<em>n</em>) (in current population) space with existing computers.
Instead, we can simply describe the system by a count of the fish at
each timer stage, since they have no other properties and we&rsquo;re only
interested in population size.</p>

<pre><code>type School = [ℕ]
</code></pre>

<p>(Treating a list as a 9-tuple, in this case.)  The initial state of
the example would be, for example, [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0].
<em>school_day</em> is then:</p>

<pre><code>school_day : School → School
school_day [z, o, tw, th, fr, fv, sx, sv, e] =
  [o, tw, th, fr, fv, sx, sv + z, e, z]
</code></pre>

<p>Ungainly though it is, this encodes in a single expression the same
rules for the simulation as the previous program&rsquo;s <em>day</em>, etc.
functions.  On each day, the population of fish at 0 (given by <em>z</em>)
first drops to zero, the same number of fish &ldquo;come into being&rdquo; at
6 and 8, then the existing populations &ldquo;shift down&rdquo; (&ldquo;ones&rdquo; become
&ldquo;zeros&rdquo;, and so on).</p>

<p>This allows us to describe the system in space independent of its
size.  We have to convert the puzzle input (lists of fish-counters)
to this population-count form; this is a simple but, again, ungainly
fold, specified by</p>

<pre><code>pop_count ns = [count (== 0) ns, …, count (== 8) ns]
</code></pre>

<p>This can be calculated with the banana split theorem, but the details
are left to the hard-nosed (see <a href="day_03.html">my discussion of Day 3</a>).
It&rsquo;s pretty
easy to see how it works, I think.</p>

<p>The solution is then given by:</p>

<pre><code>sum ∘ power school_day 256 ∘ pop_count
</code></pre>
