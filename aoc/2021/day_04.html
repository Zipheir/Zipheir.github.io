<h1>Part 1</h1>

<p>Today we&rsquo;re writing a bingo simulator.  We&rsquo;re given a (large!)
collection of boards and a stream of numbers and asked to find
some information about the (first) winning board.</p>

<p>As usual, let&rsquo;s ignore parsing completely.</p>

<p>Boards are our fundamental type of interest, but we&rsquo;ll ignore
the question of what they &ldquo;are&rdquo; and focus on the operations
we expect them to support:</p>

<pre><code>mark   : Board → ℕ → Board
marked : Board → ℕ → Bool
won    : Board → Bool
</code></pre>

<p><em>mark b k</em> takes the board
<em>b</em> to a board in which <em>k</em> is marked; if <em>k</em> is not present in <em>b</em>,
a board identical to <em>b</em> is returned.  We require of <em>mark</em> that:</p>

<pre><code>mark (mark b k) l = mark (mark b l) k
full b ⇒ mark b k = b
</code></pre>

<p>for all <em>k</em>, <em>l</em> ∈ ℕ; <em>full b</em> is true iff every element of <em>b</em> is
marked.</p>

<p><em>marked b k</em> is true iff <em>k</em> both occurs and is marked in <em>b</em>.</p>

<pre><code>    occurs b k  ⇒  is_marked (mark b k) k
¬ (occurs b k)  ⇒  ¬ (is_marked b k)
</code></pre>

<p><em>won b</em> determines whether <em>b</em> is a winning board—that is, whether it
contains a marked row or column.</p>

<p>This is all we need to describe the game:</p>

<pre><code>bingo : [Board] → [ℕ] → ℕ

bingo bs (n ∷ ns) = let bs′ = marks n bs in
                      case winner bs′ of
                        Nothing → bingo bs′ ns
                        Just b  → score b n

marks : ℕ → [Board] → [Board]
marks k = list (λ b → mark b k)

winner : [Board] → Maybe Board
winner = find won

score : Board -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
</code></pre>

<p><em>bingo bs ns</em> runs through the drawn numbers, represented by the list
<em>ns</em>, marking each in <em>bs</em> to create the next game state.  It
terminates when there is a winning board among the <em>bs</em> (we will
assume that this winner is unique) and computes the score of the
winning board.  (The recursion in <em>bingo</em> is slightly funky, since a
board&rsquo;s score depends on the last number called.) The helper functions
<em>marks</em> and <em>winner</em> mark a given number in a list of boards and find
a winning board in a list, respectively.  <em>winner</em> makes use of the
<em>find</em> function, which gives Just the first element of a list
satisfying a predicate, or Nothing if no such element exists.</p>

<p>(Another way to go about this is to follow the compositionality of
multiplayer bingo.  Since an <em>n</em>-player game of bingo is just <em>n</em>
games of solo bingo, we could specify <em>bingo</em> in terms of a function
<em>solo</em> : Board → [ℕ] → Bool, specialized to each of the boards.
<em>solo</em> can be described as a fold, leading to another use of the
banana split theorem on <em>bingo</em>.  The details are muddier than what
we have above, though.)</p>

<p>We leave the scoring function for last and go on to talking about
Boards in more detail.  We consider them as a parametric type T:</p>

<pre><code>Board = T (ℕ × Bool)
</code></pre>

<p>We expect that T is a functor and also foldable, in the sense of
the Haskell typeclass.  <em>mark</em> is then easy:</p>

<pre><code>mark b k = board (mark1 k) b

mark1 : ℕ → (ℕ × Bool) → (ℕ × Bool)
mark1 k (x, mk) = if k == x then (x, True) else (x, mk)
</code></pre>

<p><em>marked</em> is also easy, using the function
<em>any</em> : Foldable τ ⇒ (α → Bool) → τ α → Bool which returns
whether some element of a parametric foldable type satisfies a
predicate:</p>

<pre><code>marked b k = any (λ (x, mk) → k == x ∧ mk) b
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the predicate <em>won</em> involves the most work.  In this case,
we need to attach a notion of 2-D geometric structure to boards.  We
want an additional constraint on the Board type:</p>

<pre><code>S ⊆ (ℕ × ℕ) ⇒ Board ≅ S → (ℕ × Bool)
</code></pre>

<p>That is, a board is isomorphic to a function from pairs of naturals
in a certain range to possibly-marked naturals.  (I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a
lighter-weight constraint.)  This means that we can easily check if
a given &ldquo;cell&rdquo; is marked; we specify:</p>

<pre><code>cell_marked : Board → S → Bool
cell_marked b = π₂ ∘ (to b)
</code></pre>

<p>where <em>to</em> : Board → (S → (ℕ × Bool)) is a witness of the Board/map
isomorphism.  We can extract the rows or columns of a Board with
bound (k, k):</p>

<pre><code>rows : Board → [[(ℕ × Bool)]]
rows b = [[ (to b) (i, j) | j ← [0..k]] | i ← [0..k]]

cols : Board → [[(ℕ × Bool)]]
cols b = [[ (to b) (i, j) | i ← [0..k]] | j ← [0..k]]]
</code></pre>

<p>We have a winning board if a row or a column is entirely marked:</p>

<pre><code>rcmarked : [(ℕ × Bool)] → Bool
rcmarked = all π₂

won   : Board → Bool
won b = any rcmarked (rows b) ∨ any rcmarked (cols b)
</code></pre>

<p><em>any</em> is a library function analogous to <em>all</em> that
determines whether any
of the elements of a collection satisfy a predicate.  <em>any</em> is a fold,
so we could rewrite <em>rows</em> and <em>cols</em> as unfolds and apply hylomorphism
fusion, but this seems good enough for now.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s just a matter of scoring the winning board.  According to the
puzzle description, we score a board by summing all of its unmarked
elements, then multiplying their sum by the last number called.
Specify:</p>

<pre><code>score b n = n * sum (unmarked b)

unmarked : Board → [ℕ]
unmarked = foldr cons_um []

cons_um : (ℕ, Bool) → [ℕ] → [ℕ]
cons_um (_, True)  ns = ns
cons_um (n, False) ns = n ∷ ns
</code></pre>

<p>Any easy application of fold fusion gives us:</p>

<pre><code>score b n = n * sum_um b

sum_um : Board → ℕ
sum_um = foldr add_um 0

add_um (_, True)  n = n
add_um (x, False) n = x + n
</code></pre>

<h1>Part 2</h1>

<p>(TODO)</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still playing bingo, but now we want to find the last board in
our set that will win with the given numbers drawn.  We can&rsquo;t assume
that every board will eventually win, so we will run the game to its
conclusion (all boards filled, or no more numbers), then return the
score of the most-recently-filled board.</p>
