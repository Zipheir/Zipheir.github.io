<h1>Advent of Code 2021</h1>

<p>Discussions of puzzles from 2021's
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.</p>

<p>The main goal of these posts is educational, so I try to examine
the parts of the puzzles that I find interesting.  In general, this
means I ignore parsing puzzle input or other kinds of bookkeeping.  I
try to use formal reasoning and program calculation on these puzzles
to whatever extent possible.  I don't try to complete all of them, or
to keep up with the release schedule.  Languages used depend on the
problem, though I often use a generic typed ML-like language to reason
with.  As such, only basic library forms are used, which is all for the
bestâ€”there's little to be learned from digging around for the perfect
pre-fab function.</p>
