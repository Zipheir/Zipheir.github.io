<h1>Day 13 &mdash; Part 1</h1>

<p>This one involves literal folding!  Given a 2D grid (yet again) with
a set of marked coordinates, I want to fold it along a given row or
column.  Since the grid is &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;, the marks on each side of
the &ldquo;crease&rdquo; will &ldquo;show through&rdquo;, giving a new set of marked
coordinates (on a smaller grid).  The first part of this puzzle is
to find the number of marks on the grid after a single fold&ndash;the
first one given in the puzzle input.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll once again use a grid type, this time with boolean entries
indicating whether a given coordinate is marked.</p>

<pre><code>for S ⊆ (ℕ × ℕ),

Grid Bool ≅ S → Bool

hbounds : Grid α → (ℕ × ℕ)
</code></pre>

<p>Coordinates are column-major and (0, 0) is the top left entry.  Grids
can be of all sizes.  <em>hbounds g</em> gives the maximum column and row
indices for <em>g</em>.</p>

<p>Now I have to think about what it means to fold a Grid onto itself.
For simplicity, I&rsquo;ll write separate transformations for row and column
folds.  To avoid confusion, I&rsquo;m going to call these <em>crease</em>
operations.</p>

<pre><code>crease_row : ℕ → Grid Bool → Grid Bool

crease_col : ℕ → Grid Bool → Grid Bool
</code></pre>

<p><em>crease_row r g</em> can be thought of as being composed of three steps:
first, split the grid <em>g</em> into two grids on row <em>r</em>, second, &ldquo;flip
over&rdquo; one of the segments, and third, overlay them.  Here&rsquo;s the
specification (<code>;</code> is right-to-left composition):</p>

<pre><code>-- Specification
crease_row : ℕ → Grid Bool → Grid Bool
crease_row k = split_row k ; orient_v ; overlay

split_row : ℕ → Grid α → (Grid α × Grid α)

orient_v : (Grid α × Grid α) → (Grid α × Grid α)

overlay : (Grid Bool × Grid Bool) → Grid Bool
</code></pre>

<p>These functions will mostly be described abstractly, in terms of
how they map indices to elements.  This is enough to calculate with.</p>

<p>The sum of the number of rows of the two grids returned by <em>split_row</em>
will always be smaller than the row-size of the original.</p>

<p>Define</p>

<pre><code>nrows : Grid α → ℕ
nrows g = let (_, r) = hbounds g in r + 1
</code></pre>

<p>Then</p>

<pre><code>(g′, g″) := split_row g

nrows g′ + nrows g″ &lt; nrows g
</code></pre>

<p>where <em>nrows</em> : Grid α → ℕ gives the number of rows of a grid.  I&rsquo;ll
go further and postulate:</p>

<pre><code>nrows g = nrows g′ + nrows g″ + 1
</code></pre>

<p>That is, <em>split_row</em> always divides a grid equally along its central
row.  This is a big simplification; maybe it only works for the example
puzzle.  [EDIT: Yes, it holds in general.  Each crease instruction
bisects a grid.]</p>

<p>The horizontal dimension is preserved by <em>split_row</em>:</p>

<pre><code>ncols g′ = ncols g″ = ncols g
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<pre><code>ncols g = let (c, _) = hbounds g in c + 1
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the crucial property of <em>split_row k g</em>, which I&rsquo;m thinking of
here as a map T ⊆ ((ℕ × ℕ) × (ℕ × ℕ)) → Bool × Bool:</p>

<p>   (split_row k g) ! ((i, j), (p, r))</p>

<pre><code>   ⎧ ⊥, if j ≡ k ∨ r ≡ k   -- cut out the kth row
 = ⎨
   ⎩ (g ! (i, j), g ! (p, r + k + 1)), otherwise
</code></pre>

<p>This is complicated a bit by the &ldquo;cutting out&rdquo; of the <em>k</em>th row.
<code>!</code> denotes the index operation Grid α → (ℕ × ℕ) → α.</p>

<p>A similar property describes <em>split_col</em>:</p>

<p>   (split_col k g) ! ((i, j), (p, r))</p>

<pre><code>   ⎧ ⊥, if i ≡ k ∨ p ≡ k   -- cut out the kth column
 = ⎨
   ⎩ (g ! (i, j), g ! (p + k + 1, r)), otherwise
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really want to define (!) on products of Grids; this is just
a compact way to describe how these functions transform their
arguments.</p>

<p><em>overlay</em> is really the core of the function.  What are its properties?
Again, I assume for simplicity that I can only overlay grids of the
same size.  The crucial idea of &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; is captured by the
following property of <em>overlay</em>:</p>

<pre><code>(overlay (g₁, g₂)) ! (i, j) = g₁ ! (i, j) ∨ g₂ ! (i, j)
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, a place in the grid <em>overlay</em> (<em>g</em>₁, <em>g</em>₂)) is marked
iff it is marked in <em>g</em>₁ or <em>g</em>₂.  This is pretty much all the meaning
I need to work with <em>overlay</em>.</p>

<p>The puzzle promises not to put marks on the row/column of folding,
which eliminates some weird corner cases.  It also explains how to
overlay the two grid sections in each case: when folding vertically
(on rows), I&rsquo;m to fold the <em>bottom</em> section <em>up</em>, and, when folding
horizontally (on columns), I&rsquo;m to fold the <em>left</em> section <em>over</em>.</p>

<p>This is not actually a matter for <em>overlay</em>, but for the <em>orient</em>
functions.</p>

<pre><code>orient_v (gt, gb) = (gt, vflip gb)
orient_h (gl, gr) = (hflip gl, gr)
</code></pre>

<p>where <em>vflip</em> and <em>hflip</em> perform vertical and horizontal flips
of a grid, respectively:</p>

<pre><code>(vflip g) ! (i, j) = let rmax = π₂ (hbounds g) in
                       g ! (i, rmax - j)

(hflip g) ! (i, j) = let cmax = π₁ (hbounds g) in
                       g ! (cmax - i, j)
</code></pre>

<p>where <em>row_max g</em> and <em>col_max g</em> give the greatest row/column
indices of <em>g</em>, respectively.</p>

<h2>Fusion</h2>

<p>I have a specification for the <em>crease</em> functions, but it involves
creating intermediate values (the two halves of the split input
grid) only to compute the value I&rsquo;m actually interested in.  It
should be possible to calculate more efficient implementations.</p>

<pre><code>crease_row = split_row ; orient_v ; overlay
</code></pre>

<p>Thinking of grids as functions, what is the relationship between
the functions <em>g</em> and <em>crease_row k g</em>?  Clearly the domain of
the latter is a smaller subset of ℕ × ℕ.  Call it S; for
(i, j) ∈ S, I can calculate:</p>

<pre><code>  (crease_row k g) (i, j)

=   { crease_row spec. }

  (overlay (orient_v (split_row k g))) (i, j)

=   { overlay property }

  let (g₁, g₂) = orient_v (split_row k g) in
    g₁ ! (i, j) ∨ g₂ ! (i, j)

=   { orient_v def. }

  let (g₁, g₂) = split_row k g in
    g₁ ! (i, j) ∨ (vflip g₂) ! (i, j)

=   { vflip spec. }

  let (g₁, g₂) = split_row k g
      rmax     = π₂ (hbounds g₂) in
    g₁ ! (i, j) ∨ g₂ ! (i, rmax - j)
</code></pre>

<p>This eliminates all of the intermediate stuff except for
<em>split_row</em>, so I&rsquo;m almost at the point where I can compute
<em>crease_row k g</em> in terms of <em>g</em> alone.  With slight informality,
I now use the defining property of <em>split_row</em>:</p>

<pre><code>=   { split_row property }

  let (g₁, g₂) = split_row k g
      rmax     = π₂ (hbounds g₂) in
    g₁ ! (i, j) ∨ g₂ ! (i, (rmax - j) + k + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>To eliminate <em>split_row</em>, I have to calculate <em>rmax</em> without
reference to <em>g</em>₂.  This is easy, by the transforming the postulate
stated above for <em>split_row</em>:</p>

<pre><code>  nrows g₂ = nrows g - nrows g₁ - 1

≡   { nrows g₁ = k }

  nrows g₂ = nrows g - k - 1
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>π₂ (hbounds g₂) = (nrows g₂) - 1
               = (nrows g - k - 1) -1
               = nrows g - k - 2
               = (π₂ (hbounds g)) - k - 1
</code></pre>

<p>No more <em>split_row</em>:</p>

<pre><code>(crease_row k g) (i, j) =
  let rmax = (π₂ (hbounds g)) - k - 1 in
    g ! (i, j) ∨ g ! (i, (rmax - j) + k + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Arithmetic further simplifies this:</p>

<pre><code>(crease_row k g) (i, j) = g ! (i, j) ∨ g ! (i, (π₂ (hbounds g)) - j)
</code></pre>

<p>In data terms, this is sufficient to compute the result of
<em>crease_row k g</em> without building any intermediate results.
Assume there&rsquo;s a <em>grid</em> constructor (modelled on <em>array</em> from
the Data.Array Haskell library) that takes a pair of bounds
and a list of ((ℕ × ℕ) × Bool) pairs to a new grid.  Then:</p>

<pre><code>crease_row k g =
  let (c, r) = hbounds g
      rmax   = r - k - 1 in
    grid ((0, 0), (c, rmax))
      [ ((i, j), g ! (i, j) ∨ g ! (i, r - j)) |
        i ← [0..c], j ← [0..rmax] ]
</code></pre>

<p>This completes the calculation of a more space-efficient
<em>crease_row</em>.  An analogous calculation (left as an exercise for
the reader) can be used to compute <em>crease_col</em>, which is similar:</p>

<pre><code>crease_col k g =
  let (_, r) = hbounds g
      cmax   = k - 1     in
    grid ((0, 0), (cmax, r))
      [ ((i, j), g ! (cmax - i, j) ∨ g ! (i + k + 1, j)) |
        i ← [0..cmax], ← &lt;- [0..r] ]
</code></pre>

<h2>The rest</h2>

<p>Assume the grid section of the puzzle input has already been
parsed and converted into a Grid Bool, and let the folding
instructions be described by a list:</p>

<pre><code>data Inst = X ℕ | Y ℕ

[Y 7, X 5, …]
</code></pre>

<p>This is easy enough to construct from the puzzle input.
Then it&rsquo;s just a matter of folding the folds.  To get the solution
for part 1, I only need to count the number of marks visible after
the first crease.  Here&rsquo;s a more general function which can be used
for part 2, as well:</p>

<pre><code>creases : Grid Bool → [Inst] → Grid Bool
creases = fold (λ g c →
                 case c of
                   X k → crease_col k g
                   Y k → crease_row k g)

solution = marked (creases init (take 1 insts))

marked : Grid Bool → ℕ
marked = count id
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <em>init</em> is the starting grid and <em>insts</em> is the list of
fold instructions, both constructed from the puzzle input.</p>

<h1>Part 2</h1>

<p>I have to complete the folding, now, and read the digits off the
final grid.  Pretty much everything is in place to do this, except
for functions to print a grid in a readable form.  (No, I&rsquo;m not going
to write an OCR function!)  This isn&rsquo;t very interesting, but here it
is, for completeness:</p>

<pre><code>print_row :: Grid -&gt; Int -&gt; IO ()
print_row g r = sequence_
                  (map putStr
                    (map (\c → if g ! (c, r) then "#" else ".")
                         [0 .. (fst (hbounds g))])
                    ⧺ [putChar '\n'])

print_grid :: Grid -&gt; IO ()
print_grid g = sequence_ (map (print_row g)
                              [0 .. (snd (hbounds g))])
</code></pre>

<p>These functions use the (pseudo-)monadic structure of Haskell&rsquo;s
<code>IO</code> type.  If this is unfamiliar, take a look at the built-in function
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:sequence_"><code>sequence_</code></a>
and maybe Chapter 12 of Graham Hutton&rsquo;s <em>Programming in Haskell</em>.</p>
