    <h1>The Outsider</h1>

    <h2>A Sketch</h2>

    <h3>by Wolfgang Corcoran-Mathe</h3>

    <div class="essay">
      <p>I always wonder what happened to the homeschoolers who were
      raised, like I was, without a religion to give them a place in
      life. For a while New York City was full of them: children of
      artists, anarchists, and other bohemians, children with odd names
      and interests. Many were “unschooled”, given free rein to play in
      the park or to do whatever else interested them. Even for the ones
      who were given some kind of formal education the idea of spending
      eight hours a day confined with hundreds of other kids to a massive
      brick building was horrifying. It didn’t occur to them to respect
      authority, and they didn’t form groups easily—they stuck to their
      families. Think of people like that trying to find their way in a
      place like New York, a city of ruthless competition whose honest
      slogan might be “if you can’t make it here, there are plenty of
      other people who can”. Even the hungry young people who flock to
      the city from all over the world knowing they’ll have to be willing
      to do anything to succeed there, knowing how to make connections,
      knowing to respect authority when it’s to their advantage, find
      New York a tough nut to crack. What does a city-bred kid without
      those advantages do?</p>

      <p>At least a decade before me, Karl (as I’ll call him) was such a
      kid. He didn’t move to New York with a dream and a gleam in the
      eye; he had the misfortune to be born there and to find it closed
      to him. He really lived it.</p>

      <p>When I met Karl he was a tallish, 25-year-old man with big limbs
      and a tendency toward chubbiness. He had a light olive complexion,
      a round chin, broad forehead, and heavy, dark eyelids. He slicked
      back his wavy black hair with scented castor oil and was fond of
      Versace cologne, which he bought cheap in the wholesale district. He
      had a proud, splay-footed walk, a loud, baritone voice, and a broad
      smirk that suggested hidden laughter. His Italianate clothes and
      swagger might put you in mind of a smart-alec real estate agent, or
      maybe a small-time pizzeria owner with aspirations to
      Mafioso-hood.</p>

      <p>Karl coached at his family’s fencing club in Chelsea. He had
      been a successful fencer himself, though he never reached his
      brother’s Olympian level of achievement. By the time I met him his
      competing days were over and he was happier tinkering with fencing
      equipment or the club’s arcade machines than he was giving lessons.
      He’d turned a small office next to the fencing strips into his
      workshop, where he’d solder broken body cords or attach wires
      and tips to electric fencing blades. He’d inherited a distrust
      of authority and a self-reliant mindset from his parents. They
      were flea-market entrepreneurial types who had drifted around
      the Northeast, homeschooling Karl and his brother through the
      1980s when the practice wasn’t entirely legal. Truant officers
      were fairy-tale bogeymen for homeschoolers of my generation, but
      they were a real threat for Karl. His various homes had received
      official visits, during which he’d hid in his parents’ van.</p>

      <p>Just as trees in cold regions lose their branches to yearly
      snows, so school-going children have their interests pared down
      by the weight of popular opinion. Homeschooling had shielded
      Karl. He had been a chubby teenager with solitary interests,
      including some—comics and anime—that would’ve been rich sources
      of mockery in public school. He also loved crafts, especially
      leather working and electronics. He knew a lot about rock music
      and film, though nobody knew where he’d got his knowledge; these
      were the pre-Wikipedia days, and Karl didn’t read much anyway.
      He acted like he’d taught himself everything he knew.</p>

      <p>His weaknesses were obvious. With young fencers like me he was
      brash and endlessly sarcastic. He was determined that they look up
      to him and would make an ass of himself seeing that they did.
      When a group of middle-school kids were gathered around one
      of his favorite arcade games, he’d barge in, commanding them
      to shove over so that he could demonstrate his superior skill.
      He swore constantly, told lewd stories, and was generally a bad
      influence on his young students. (And young students were about
      all he had, being by no means the club’s most popular coach.) The
      kids thought Karl outrageous. Some of the teenagers, detecting
      weakness, treated him with mild contempt.</p>

      <p>Karl’s opinions were dogmatic in the extreme when it came to
      music and movies. As far as he was concerned my taste was terrible
      and badly in need of remedy. One day I brought my binder of music
      CDs to the club. It didn’t contain much beyond Paul Simon’s
      <cite>Graceland</cite>,
      an Elvis Presley greatest-hits anthology which I’d received as a
      gift, Leonard Bernstein’s
      1964 recording of Beethoven’s 9th symphony, and, for some reason,
      most of the Gipsy Kings discography. Karl grabbed the binder and
      ran through the pages quickly.</p>

      <p>“There’s only one CD in here that isn’t garbage,” he said,
      snapping the binder shut.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I know, the Beethoven, right?” I hung my head and tried
      to come up with some excuses. “I need to get more classical, but
      I don’t know which CDs to buy.”</p>

      <p>“No.” He flipped through the binder again, held it up, and pointed
      at a disc. “The Elvis.”</p>

      <p>If you shared Karl’s interests, though, he was generous with more
      than just his opinions. When I began learning guitar, he brought me
      a stack of guitar magazines and a library of his favorite albums,
      nearly 50 of them, which I was to return to him only after I’d
      carefully studied each one. He brought his own guitar to the club
      to play with me. It was an Ibanez single-pickup electric with a
      beautiful teal sunburst and a stingray-leather strap that Karl
      had made himself. He taught me a lot about electric guitar, like
      how to use a flexible pick to play the high-speed strumming solo
      from Buddy Holly’s <cite class="song">Peggy Sue</cite>.
      In his rare wistful moods he’d
      talk of getting away from his family and the city to live on the
      road as a wandering trucker-guitarist. The details were vague; it
      was clearly an old dream which he hadn’t taken seriously in
      years.</p>

      <p>In December 2003 his family was evicted from their fencing club.
      They hadn’t paid their $26,000-a-month rent for over six months,
      a fact which they’d characteristically kept secret. I got a
      notice to show up and claim my stuff from the locked-up club,
      and waited almost an hour in the rain with one of the coaches, a
      quiet Korean, for the collection agents to let us in. The club,
      which had always been brightly lit and noisy with shouts and
      clashing blades, was dark and silent.</p>

      <p>It was a shock with elements of betrayal. Up until then I had
      been working for Karl informally, repairing equipment in exchange
      for spare parts. He’d been as tight-lipped to me as the rest of
      his family. So much for friendship, or at least apprenticeship, I
      thought. From what little I knew of people at that time, it didn’t
      seem likely we’d have anything further to do with each other. But
      a month or so after the club was shut down Karl called me up and
      suggested lunch. Brash and jocular, he offered no explanation.
      I was short of friends and needed something to do now that the
      fencing club was gone. Why bring up a sore subject? I figured
      we’d get around to it at lunch.</p>

      <p>We met at Great New York Noodletown, near Canal Street, on a
      damp day in January. We talked about music and I began to get
      the awkward feeling that I had, for example, waited too long to
      admit that I didn’t know somebody’s name. From Karl’s unassailable,
      big-brotherly attitude, you would’ve thought nothing had happened;
      he never mentioned the club, let alone the eviction. I knew that
      he was smoothly dodging the issue and was quite sure I considered
      this dodging ungentlemanly. But again, my friend count was close
      to nil and there wasn’t much for a homeschooled teenager to get up
      to during the school week. We started getting lunch and wandering
      around Chinatown regularly.</p>

      <p>Karl knew dozens of odd holes in the wall throughout lower
      Manhattan and seemed absolutely confident in situations that I had
      as yet no idea how to handle. He joked with street merchants who
      spoke only a few words of English. Out of pure curiosity he would
      order mysterious items at Vietnamese restaurants, dishes he could
      only order by pointing to the menu listing. His street sense, that
      ability of city dwellers to sense danger from the smallest hints,
      was impeccable. We were about to board an uptown-bound 1
      train one day when Karl put a hand on my shoulder and steered me
      to a different car. Once we’d taken our seats, I told him that
      of course I’d seen the shabby, tipsy-looking guy taking up three
      seats in the other car, but hadn’t thought he looked dangerous.</p>

      <p>Karl was a closer observer. “He had a glass bottle,” he said.</p>

      <p>I shrugged. “So?”</p>

      <p>“So nine times out of ten he sits there and drinks. The tenth
      time he breaks the bottle and stabs somebody with the neck.”</p>

      <p>But nothing impressed me more than his ease and purported ability
      with women. (Or, as I called them before I started hanging out
      with Karl, “girls”.) At the sedate age of 26, Karl had a steady
      girlfriend and the air of a man who’d known every good-looking
      woman in New York before settling down with the cream of the
      crop. He had stories (many of which I now think were invented or
      picked up second-hand) involving acts and situations I could only
      fantasize about.</p>

      <p>And yet this swaggering, street-wise, self-reliant ladies’ man
      lived with his mother and father in a basement apartment in south
      Chelsea. For spending money he sold collectible toys on eBay.
      He was cagey in the extreme about his finances, telling people
      he “worked at a bank” to put off uncomfortable questions. Once,
      fretting about ways to make a living, I asked him seriously how much
      he made off eBay. He delivered the preposterous figure of $90,000 a
      year, smirking so as to make it clear he’d made it up on the spot.
      “You don’t need to know my business.” He seemed to suspect everyone,
      friend and stranger alike, of laughing at him behind his back.</p>

      <p>Karl loved to be copied, just as he hated to be criticized. It
      was a fine thing when I got into blues and country music, but
      he was less than pleased when I failed to appreciate his beloved
      ’80s rock. “Blues is fine, but at some point you want something
      more.” I acquiesced but mumbled something about not being sure it
      was Sammy Hagar I wanted. Karl never stopped bringing me albums,
      though, and he did pay attention to my opinions before shooting
      them down. (He was, for example, distinctly hurt when I suggested
      George Harrison wasn’t much of a lead guitarist.) At some point
      he learned how to copy laserdiscs (his favorite video format)
      to DVD, and began bringing me movies to watch as well. He had a
      special fondness for Toho monster movies, Akira Kurosawa’s samurai
      films, Sergio Leone’s westerns, and anything with Lee Marvin.
      One movie that bothered him was <cite>Easy Rider</cite>.
      After I watched
      the copy he’d made me, we had a talk about the ending, in which
      the main characters played by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper are
      gunned down by rednecks. He seemed really shaken by it. “I don’t
      understand that hatred, you know?” he said, shaking his head.
      His parents had been hippies, of a sort. “They weren’t hurting
      anybody. They just wanted to live differently.”</p>

      <p>This was the Bloomberg era and the city was changing quickly even
      by New York standards. Karl couldn’t stand it or the people who
      flocked into town to see the worst of the place. One afternoon I
      met up with him after he’d been standing around waiting on some
      corner for a while. “Death and destruction!” he sang as I walked
      up. He mimed playing a guitar solo. “Death and destruct-tion!”</p>

      <p>“What’s this?” I said. “You’re writing songs now?”</p>

      <p>He played some more guitar and repeated the chorus. “All the
      people wanna see is—death and destruction!”</p>

      <p>Later it came out that, while waiting, he’d been asked by several
      tourists how to get to Ground Zero. “There’s all this stuff to do
      in the city and they come here to see a hole. Death and destruction.
      What the fuck is wrong with people?”</p>

      <p>New York was hell; the country—that vague, enormous place that
      exists outside the pocket universe of the city—was Karl’s utopia.
      “I need to get out of this city,” he said again and again. “Away
      from these fucking people. Country people aren’t like this.
      They’re simpler people.”</p>

      <p>After a year and a half I’d nearly forgotten about the eviction.
      Certainly Karl never brought it up, and the one time I’d asked
      him about it he’d called it “a weird part of my life”, without
      elaborating. Then, on a hot Saturday at the end of summer 2005,
      crisis hit.</p>

      <p>We had made a general agreement to meet up for lunch, but Karl
      wasn’t answering his phone. To kill time I watched one of the movies
      he’d burned for me: another Japanese monster film, this one without
      subtitles. It was nearly over when Karl finally called. I eagerly
      told him I’d seen <cite>Yog, Monster from Space</cite> and that I
      had indeed
      caught the scene in which the light bulbs in Yog’s eyes were out.
      Karl’s voice conveyed none of the gratification I’d expected for
      praising one of his gift discs. I couldn’t get a straight answer
      when I asked him what he’d been doing all morning, so I asked
      him about lunch. He said he had work to do and couldn’t do much
      hanging out. If there was an Internet café in my neighborhood,
      though, I could meet him there.</p>

      <p>“It turns out I’m going to be moving,” he added.</p>

      <p>This was a surprise. He didn’t sound at all happy about it,
      which, something told me, meant it was more likely to be factual
      than Karl’s usual napkin sketches for getting out of his parents’
      apartment. I knew prodding him on the details would get me
      nowhere, so I decided to be strategically blithe. I said: “Wow,
      that’s good news, man!”</p>

      <p>Half an hour later I met him at a news shop on Third and 12th
      that doubled as a tiny Internet café. Karl shook hands tensely
      and didn’t enlighten me as to why he needed a rental computer.
      It was a sweltering afternoon and the store was cool and quiet.
      The computer desks were set up in rows and, to the detriment of
      user privacy, surrounded on all sides by magazine racks.</p>

      <p>Karl signed in at the counter and picked out a computer. He sat
      down and motioned me over.</p>

      <p>“No, you go ahead,” I said. “Send your emails. I’ll wait.”</p>

      <p>“Come on, dude. I want to show you something.”</p>

      <p>Even with the place deserted I was nervous about sitting down in
      front of an unpaid-for computer, so I stood awkwardly behind Karl.
      He opened a Web browser and, to my horror, navigated to a porn
      site.</p>

      <p>“Karl,” I whispered, “come on, not here.” I fidgeted and looked
      around to see if the clerk behind the counter was watching. Karl
      clicked and scrolled through pages of explicit thumbnails with
      contemptuous casualness.</p>

      <p>“Here it is. Stand still and watch this.”</p>

      <p>He clicked a link and a small video window opened. A man, or
      rather the lower half of one, was helping an East Asian woman
      keep track of some money—namely, a dollar bill that he skillfully
      packed into her vagina without the use of his hands. Karl watched
      intently, chuckling.</p>

      <p>I was sweating and my eyes flicked back and forth between the
      video—it wasn’t exactly easy to ignore—and the rest of the shop.
      At any moment I expected a customer to come in and make a beeline
      for the magazines behind us, or, worse, an employee to cut off
      Karl’s computer and kick us out. Did they have a way to know when
      somebody was watching porn on their computers?</p>

      <p>The video was mercifully short. “Alright, enough,” I said. “I
      thought you had work to do.”</p>

      <p>Karl laughed. “Stop worrying, man. It’s not going to warp your
      fragile little mind. You’ve got to understand the kind of shit
      that happens in the real world.” He nodded toward the screen,
      where the video’s final frame was still visible. “That’s what’s
      happening to me,” he said. “I’m getting fucked the same way.”</p>

      <p>He closed the porn site after that and opened his email. For
      the next hour and a half he looked sour and said approximately
      nothing. I wandered around the shop, bored, worried, and annoyed,
      glancing at the magazines. Hanging around a newsstand with a
      taciturn Karl was not what I’d expected to do with my afternoon.
      “I’ll give him five minutes,” I grumbled to myself several times.
      Each time I hung around.</p>

      <p>Finally he got up and paid for his time, then asked if I wanted
      to get some lunch. Karl was still short of time, apparently, so we
      went to a White Castle a block away from the news shop. It was the
      worst lunch I’d ever known Karl to eat. He was nearly silent until
      we’d finished our food. Finally I asked him what was bothering him.
      </p>

      <p>“They might take everything I own,” he said bluntly. “Any time
      in the next six months.”</p>

      <p>I didn’t ask who “they” were. By now I’d guessed: the collection
      agency had caught up with him. “What’re you going to do?”</p>

      <p>“I’m going to move in with Joan,” he said. (Joan was his
      girlfriend.) “For now.”</p>

      <p>“You OK, man?”</p>

      <p>“Maybe.”</p>

      <p>As we left the grimy restaurant I said something about being
      ready to help.</p>

      <p>He nodded absently and shook my hand. “See you, man.” He started
      to walk away, then paused and added vehemently: “Don’t put off
      getting out of your parents’ place, dude. When you turn 18, just
      get your shit together and go.”</p>

      <p>I had the distinct feeling he wasn’t talking to me.</p>

      <p>So Karl moved out and crammed his laserdiscs, guitars, and stock
      of collectibles into his girlfriend’s small, shared apartment
      in SoHo. Joan didn’t seem to mind. She was an odd character who
      designed clothes and occasionally sang country. She had wandered
      around the US during a nomadic earlier period and was quite an
      individualist. She had hard-edged opinions about poverty and would
      sometimes tell me to read Ayn Rand. Karl, who had not exactly lived
      on his own means up to that point, somehow escaped her censure.
      Since Joan was at least 15 years his senior and too intelligent
      to fall for his bluster, I figured she had a genuine liking for him.
      </p>

      <p>After a few months of apartment hunting they found a place in
      Astoria. To get there you took the N or W train all the way to the
      end of the line, then walked a few blocks past houses decorated
      with Greek flags and plaster statues. It was a decent-sized
      apartment by New York standards, although it was a bit shabby
      and shared a wall with the landlord’s family.</p>

      <p>Karl quickly ran into trouble with the landlord, over the usual
      quirks of apartment life. Things didn’t work, those things
      frequently being the radiators and hot water boiler—hardly minor
      matters in what was shaping up to be a cold winter. The landlord,
      a stout, middle-aged Greek, rhapsodized about the quality and
      expense of the work he’d already done on the apartment. A few
      easy issues got fixed, but the heating problems continued.</p>

      <p>An experienced apartment dweller would find this neither
      surprising nor particularly nefarious. But Karl was not an
      experienced apartment dweller. His father, a super himself, had
      never taught him the art of janitorial diplomacy. So he raged
      at the landlord,
      at the landlord’s family, and at the (Greek) broker who had found
      the apartment in the first place. But mostly he just raged. He was
      furious when, coming back to the apartment from a shopping trip,
      he found the landlord’s wife poking around inside. He immediately
      bought a door chain and installed it, quietly, in the dead of night.
      The landlord saw it on the door the next morning and demanded he
      remove it. Karl refused and said he’d call the police if there
      were any more intrusions. Offended, the landlord said something
      about not being able to repair anything if he couldn’t get into
      the apartment, and that was the end of civil communication. Like
      many New Yorkers Karl resorted to making loud noises to express
      his feelings: he’d slam the closet door along the shared wall four
      or five times, as hard as possible. He got to be quite punctual
      about doing this at times when it was most likely to be annoying.
      “Wake up, you Greek bastards!” he would yell.</p>

      <p>The morning of New Year’s Day, 2006, when Karl and Joan broke
      their lease and moved out, was a splendid fiasco. There was no
      way for us to avoid the landlord’s family as we took things out
      to the moving truck. The landlord and his wife ran out of their
      part of the house, alerted by Karl’s wall-rattling wake-up call,
      to hurl invective at their soon-to-be ex-tenants. I lugged boxes
      in silence as Karl, Joan, and the Greeks exchanged insults.
      It was a crisp, freezing, holiday morning, and the street was
      silent except for the shouting match. At one point a dismayed
      garbage man jumped down from his truck to try and break it up.
      “Whoa, whoa, people! Calm down! It’s a new year!”</p>

      <p>So Karl and Joan settled in a quiet red-brick apartment building
      in Forest Hills, where they were lucky enough to have working
      heat and plumbing. The owner was a faceless management company
      that left Karl in peace to set up his toys and laserdiscs. There
      was a roomy bedroom in which Joan hung up a photo of Karl playing
      at his first guitar recital: a scared-looking, pudgy 12-year-old
      bent over the same teal Ibanez, which looked enormous in his hands.
      </p>

      <p>That was about where I left Karl. By the time I turned 18 we had
      few interests in common: I was listening to Bach and Schoenberg,
      while Karl had developed a love of psychobilly, possibly the most
      obnoxious music invented by the human species. He still brought me
      things to listen to, but the “you need to listen to better music”
      routine was getting old and sour. The conditions of friendship with
      Karl never changed: you were supposed to (1) emulate him, and (2)
      never criticize him. I finally violated the second condition one
      summer afternoon when Karl threw a minor tantrum. “If you don’t
      want to hang out, man, we can get together another time,” I said.
      He stalked off toward the F station, heading back to Forest Hills.
      That was the last time I saw him.</p>

      <p>I looked him up on the Web from time to time. He eventually
      moved to Pennsylvania, presumably burning his bridges to the
      hated city on the way out. On his Myspace profile he called
      himself a “supreme outsider” who had never gone to school, never
      held a job, etc. What <em>had</em> he done? It was impossible to
      tell, since he carefully obscured his past. Eventually his social
      media profiles disappeared and he became nearly lost to the Internet
      as well. Then, in the 2020s, he showed up in a theatrical production
      somewhere in Delaware, calling himself “a jackass of all trades.”
      There was a photo. The smart clothes, thrust-out chest, and
      know-it-all smirk had barely changed. To all appearances he
      still had the same persona: the swaggering smart-ass, the canny,
      unsentimental man of the world.</p>

      <p>But long ago, on a cold, late fall day in New York City, with
      rain beginning to fall, I’d met Karl on a corner near his parents’
      place in Chelsea. He wore his plain, navy-blue, woolen watch
      cap (he hated umbrellas), and gray raincoat, with plain jeans
      and loafers. Under his arm he held a plain plastic bag full of
      discs he’d burned for me. In true New York style he was trying
      to look like a businessman waiting for a colleague, indifferent
      to the young denizens of New New York who passed him by,
      many of them astoundingly good-looking and in their first few
      years of city life. They were school kids, at heart, effortlessly
      fashionable, effortlessly cynical, strutting uptown to a wine
      bar, business lounge, or some other amenity provided for them by
      their city—for their city it was.</p>

      <p>Karl waited, outside, in the rain. He was not one of them.</p>
