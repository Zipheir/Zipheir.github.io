# Origami programming notes index

These are my notes and exercise solutions from "Origami Programming"
by Jeremy Gibbons (chapter 3 of The Fun of Programming by Gibbons
and Oege de Moor).  Not all of the exercises are complete.  For these
exercises, I restricted myself to program calculation as much as
possible.
