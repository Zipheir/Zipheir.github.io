<p>An identifier can name either a type of syntax or a location where
a value can be stored. An identifier that names a type of syntax is
called a <dfn>syntactic keyword</dfn> and is said to be <dfn>bound</dfn> to
a transformer for that syntax. An identifier that names a location
is called a <dfn>variable</dfn> and is said to be <dfn>bound</dfn> to that
location. The set of all visible bindings in effect at some point
in a program is known as the <dfn>environment</dfn> in effect at that
point. The value stored in the location to which a variable is bound
is called the variable&rsquo;s value. By abuse of terminology, the variable
is sometimes said to name the value or to be bound to the value. This
is not quite accurate, but confusion rarely results from this practice.
</p>
<span id="index-binding-construct"></span>

<p>Certain expression types are used to create new kinds of syntax and to
bind syntactic keywords to those new syntaxes, while other expression
types create new locations and bind variables to those locations. These
expression types are called <dfn>binding constructs</dfn>. Those
that bind syntactic keywords are listed in <a href="Macros.html">Macros</a>. The most
fundamental of the variable binding constructs is the <code>lambda</code>
expression, because all other variable binding constructs (except
top-level bindings) can be explained in terms of <code>lambda</code>
expressions. The other variable binding constructs are <code>let</code>,
<code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, <code>letrec*</code>, <code>let-values</code>,
<code>let*-values</code>, and <code>do</code> expressions (see <a href="Procedures.html">Procedures</a>,
<a href="Binding-constructs.html">Binding constructs</a>, and <a href="Iteration.html">Iteration</a>).
</p>
<span id="index-bound"></span>

<p>Scheme is a language with block structure. To each place where an
identifier is bound in a program there corresponds a <dfn>region</dfn>
of the program text within which the binding is visible. The region
is determined by the particular binding construct that establishes
the binding; if the binding is established by a <code>lambda</code>
expression, for example, then its region is the entire <code>lambda</code>
expression. Every mention of an identifier refers to the binding
of the identifier that established the innermost of the regions
containing the use. If there is no binding of the identifier whose
region contains the use, then the use refers to the binding for the
variable in the global environment, if any (<a href="Expressions.html">Expressions</a> and
<a href="Standard-procedures.html">Standard procedures</a>); if there is no binding for the identifier,
it is said to be <dfn>unbound</dfn>.
