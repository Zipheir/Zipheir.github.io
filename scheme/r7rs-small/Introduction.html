<span id="Introduction-1"></span><h2 class="unnumbered">Introduction</h2>

<p>Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top
of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary. Scheme demonstrates that a very
small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions
on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient
programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the
major programming paradigms in use today.
</p>
<p>Scheme was one of the first programming languages to incorporate
first-class procedures as in the lambda calculus, thereby proving the
usefulness of static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically
typed language. Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to
distinguish procedures from lambda expressions and symbols, to use
a single lexical environment for all variables, and to evaluate the
operator position of a procedure call in the same way as an operand
position. By relying entirely on procedure calls to express iteration,
Scheme emphasized the fact that tail-recursive procedure calls are
essentially GOTOs that pass arguments, thus allowing a programming
style that is both coherent and efficient. Scheme was the first widely
used programming language to embrace first-class escape procedures,
from which all previously known sequential control structures can be
synthesized. A subsequent version of Scheme introduced the concept
of exact and inexact numbers, an extension of Common Lisp&rsquo;s generic
arithmetic. More recently, Scheme became the first programming
language to support hygienic macros, which permit the syntax of a
block-structured language to be extended in a consistent and reliable
manner.
</p>
<span id="Background"></span><h3 class="heading">Background</h3>

<p>The first description of Scheme was written in 1975 [<a href="References.html#Scheme75">Scheme75</a>]. A
revised report [<a href="References.html#Scheme78">Scheme78</a>] appeared in 1978, which described
the evolution of the language as its MIT implementation was upgraded
to support an innovative compiler [<a href="References.html#Rabbit">Rabbit</a>]. Three distinct
projects began in 1981 and 1982 to use variants of Scheme for courses
at MIT, Yale, and Indiana University [<a href="References.html#Rees82">Rees82</a>, <a href="References.html#MITScheme">MITScheme</a>,
<a href="References.html#Scheme311">Scheme311</a>] An introductory computer science textbook using
Scheme was published in 1984 [<a href="References.html#SICP">SICP</a>].
</p>
<p>As Scheme became more widespread, local dialects began to diverge
until students and researchers occasionally found it difficult to
understand code written at other sites.  Fifteen representatives of
the major implementations of Scheme therefore met in October 1984 to
work toward a better and more widely accepted standard for Scheme.
Their report, the RRRS [<a href="References.html#RRRS">RRRS</a>], was published at MIT and Indiana
University in the summer of 1985. Further revision took place in
the spring of 1986, resulting in the R3RS [<a href="References.html#R3RS">R3RS</a>]. Work in the
spring of 1988 resulted in R4RS [<a href="References.html#R4RS">R4RS</a>], which became the basis
for the IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language in 1991
[<a href="References.html#IEEEScheme">IEEEScheme</a>]. In 1998, several additions to the IEEE standard,
including high-level hygienic macros, multiple return values, and eval,
were finalized as the R<sup>5</sup>RS [<a href="References.html#R5RS">R5RS</a>].
</p>
<p>In the fall of 2006, work began on a more ambitious standard, including
many new improvements and stricter requirements made in the interest
of improved portability. The resulting standard, the R<sup>6</sup>RS, was
completed in August 2007 [<a href="References.html#R6RS">R6RS</a>], and was organized as a
core language and set of mandatory standard libraries. Several new
implementations of Scheme conforming to it were created. However,
most existing R<sup>5</sup>RS implementations (even excluding those which
are essentially unmaintained) did not adopt R<sup>6</sup>RS, or adopted
only selected parts of it.
</p>
<p>In consequence, the Scheme Steering Committee decided in August 2009
to divide the standard into two separate but compatible languages&mdash;a
&ldquo;small&rdquo; language, suitable for educators, researchers, and users
of embedded languages, focused on R<sup>5</sup>RS compatibility, and a
&ldquo;large&rdquo; language focused on the practical needs of mainstream
software development, intended to become a replacement for
R<sup>6</sup>RS. The present report describes the &ldquo;small&rdquo; language of
that effort: therefore it cannot be considered in isolation as the
successor to R<sup>6</sup>RS.
</p>
<p>We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme community, and
so we grant permission to copy it in whole or in part without fee. In
particular, we encourage implementers of Scheme to use this report
as a starting point for manuals and other documentation, modifying
it as necessary.
