<p>It is useful to distinguish between numbers that are represented exactly
and those that might not be. For example, indexes into data structures
must be known exactly, as must some polynomial coefficients in a
symbolic algebra system. On the other hand, the results of measurements
are inherently inexact, and irrational numbers may be approximated by
rational and therefore inexact approximations. In order to catch uses
of inexact numbers where exact numbers are required, Scheme explicitly
distinguishes exact from inexact numbers. This distinction is orthogonal
to the dimension of type.
</p>
<p>A Scheme number is <dfn>exact</dfn> if it was written as an exact constant
or was derived from exact numbers using only exact operations. A number
is <dfn>inexact</dfn> if it was written as an inexact constant, if it was
derived using <dfn>inexact</dfn> ingredients, or if it was derived using
<dfn>inexact</dfn> operations. Thus inexactness is a contagious property of
a number.  In particular, an <dfn>exact complex number</dfn> has an exact
real part and an exact imaginary part; all other complex numbers are
<dfn>inexact complex numbers</dfn>.
</p>
<p>If two implementations produce exact results for a computation that
did not involve inexact intermediate results, the two ultimate results
will be mathematically equal. This is generally not true of computations
involving inexact numbers since approximate methods such as floating-point
arithmetic may be used, but it is the duty of each implementation to
make the result as close as practical to the mathematically ideal result.
</p>
<p>Rational operations such as <code>+</code> should always produce exact
results when given exact arguments. If the operation is unable to
produce an exact result, then it may either report the violation of an
implementation restriction or it may silently coerce its result to an
inexact value. However, <code>(/ 3 4)</code> must not return the mathematically
incorrect value <code>0</code>.  See <a href="Implementation-restrictions.html">Implementation restrictions</a>.
</p>
<p>Except for <code>exact</code>, the operations described in this section must
generally return inexact results when given any inexact arguments. An
operation may, however, return an exact result if it can prove that the
value of the result is unaffected by the inexactness of its arguments. For
example, multiplication of any number by an exact zero may produce an
exact zero result, even if the other argument is inexact.
</p>
<p>Specifically, the expression <code>(* 0 +inf.0)</code> may return <code>0</code>,
or <code>+nan.0</code>, or report that inexact numbers are not supported,
or report that non-rational real numbers are not supported, or fail
silently or noisily in other implementation-specific ways.
