<p>This section gives an overview of Scheme&rsquo;s semantics. A detailed
informal semantics is the subject of chapters <a href="Basic-concepts.html">Basic concepts</a>
through <a href="Standard-procedures.html">Standard procedures</a>. For reference purposes,
<a href="Formal-semantics.html">Formal semantics</a> provides a formal semantics of Scheme.
</p>
<p>Scheme is a statically scoped programming language. After macros are
expanded, each use of a
variable is associated with a lexically apparent binding of that
variable.
</p>
<p>Scheme is a dynamically typed language. Types are associated with
values (also called objects) rather than with variables. Statically
typed languages, by contrast, associate types with variables and
expressions as well as with values.
</p>
<p>All objects created in the course of a Scheme computation, including
procedures and continuations, have unlimited extent. No Scheme object
is ever destroyed. The reason that implementations of Scheme do not
(usually!) run out of storage is that they are permitted to reclaim
the storage occupied by an object if they can prove that the object
cannot possibly matter to any future computation. Implementations
of Scheme are required to be properly tail-recursive. This allows
the execution of an iterative computation in constant space, even if
the iterative computation is described by a syntactically recursive
procedure. Thus with a properly tail-recursive implementation,
iteration can be expressed using the ordinary procedure-call mechanics,
so that special iteration constructs are useful only as syntactic
sugar. See <a href="Proper-tail-recursion.html">Proper tail recursion</a>.
</p>
<p>Scheme procedures are objects in their own right. Procedures can be
created dynamically, stored in data structures, returned as results of
procedures, and so on. One distinguishing feature of Scheme is that
continuations, which in most other languages only operate behind the
scenes, also have &ldquo;first-class&rdquo; status. Continuations are useful for
implementing a wide variety of advanced control constructs, including
non-local exits, backtracking, and coroutines. See <a href="Control-features.html">Control features</a>.
</p>
<p>Arguments to Scheme procedures are always passed by value, which
means that the actual argument expressions are evaluated before
the procedure gains control, regardless of whether the procedure
needs the result of the evaluation. Scheme&rsquo;s model of arithmetic is
designed to remain as independent as possible of the particular ways
in which numbers are represented within a computer. In Scheme, every
integer is a rational number, every rational is a real, and every real
is a complex number. Thus the distinction between integer and real
arithmetic, so important to many programming languages, does not appear
in Scheme. In its place is a distinction between exact arithmetic,
which corresponds to the mathematical ideal, and inexact arithmetic
on approximations. Exact arithmetic is not limited to integers.
