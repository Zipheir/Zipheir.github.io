<span id="Storage-model-1"></span><h3 class="section">3.4 Storage model</h3>

<span id="index-location"></span>

<p>Variables and objects such as pairs, strings, vectors, and bytevectors
implicitly denote locations or sequences of locations. A string,
for example, denotes as many locations as there are characters in the
string. A new value can be stored into one of these locations using
the <code>string-set!</code> procedure, but the string continues to denote
the same locations as before.
</p>
<p>An object fetched from a location, by a variable reference or by a
procedure such as <code>car</code>, <code>vector-ref</code>, or <code>string-ref</code>,
is equivalent in the sense of <code>eqv?</code> (<a href="Equivalence-predicates.html">Equivalence predicates</a>) to the object last stored in the location before the
fetch.
</p>
<p>Every location is marked to show whether it is in use. No variable
or object ever refers to a location that is not in use.
</p>
<p>Whenever this report speaks of storage being newly allocated for
a variable or object, what is meant is that an appropriate number
of locations are chosen from the set of locations that are not in
use, and the chosen locations are marked to indicate that they
are now in use before the variable or object is made to denote
them. Notwithstanding this, it is understood that the empty list
cannot be newly allocated, because it is a unique object. It is also
understood that empty strings, empty vectors, and empty bytevectors,
which contain no locations, may or may not be newly allocated.
</p>
<span id="index-mutable"></span>
<span id="index-immutable"></span>

<p>Every object that denotes locations is either mutable
or immutable. Literal constants, the strings returned by
<code>symbol-&gt;string</code>, and possibly the environment returned by
<code>scheme-report-environment</code> are immutable objects. All objects
created by the other procedures listed in this report are mutable. It
is an error to attempt to store a new value into a location that is
denoted by an immutable object.
</p>
<p>These locations are to be understood as conceptual, not
physical. Hence, they do not necessarily correspond to memory
addresses, and even if they do, the memory address might not be
constant.
</p>
<span id="Rationale_003a"></span><h4 class="subheading">Rationale:</h4>
<span id="index-constant"></span>

<p>In many systems it is desirable for constants (i.e. the values
of literal expressions) to reside in read-only memory. Making it
an error to alter constants permits this implementation strategy,
while not requiring other systems to distinguish between mutable and
immutable objects.
