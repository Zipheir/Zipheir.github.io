    <h2>A Discipline of Version Control</h2>

    <p>Some dogmatic opinions about the practice of version control:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The centralized (single trunk repository) model of version control
      is simplest. Prefer it. If you must use a decentralized system like Git,
      don't create forks needlessly.</p></li>

      <li><p><em>Never</em> rewrite history. Undo commits with new
      commits.</p></li>

      <li><p>If a system provides "lightweight" (Git-style) branches, treat them
      like "real" branches; i.e. assume that everything committed to them will
      be forever part of your repository's history. A branch is an abstraction
      barrier, not a way to save face.</p></li>

      <li><p>Don't create unneeded or "topic" branches. Each additional branch
      in a repository makes the project harder to understand.</p></li>

      <li><p>Write commit messages carefully: use standard spelling and
      punctuation, and make sure they clearly express the changes made and, if
      the commit is significant, the reasons for making them. Make things
      clear. It may be a decade or more before someone needs to understand
      your changes.</p></li>

      <li><p>Be careful not to stuff unrelated changes into a merge commit. If
      major changes are needed before you can merge cleanly, record them in
      ordinary commits.</p></li>

      <li><p>Avoid using clever tricks and unfamiliar VCS features. Complicated
      version-control practices create complicated software. (You need look no
      further than Git for evidence of this.)</p></li>

      <li><p>Large repositories are like large program source files with
      many global names: it can be hard to trace connections between
      components. Using programming languages with good abstraction
      barriers (modules, in particular) can ease understanding, but so
      can keeping repositories small and focused. For this reason,
      "monorepos", which lump together many projects, should be
      avoided.</p></li>
    </ul>
