    <p>Kim Corcoran was born on Oct. 18, 1955 in Albion, NY and grew up in
    Kendall, a small town approximately 35 miles from Rochester, NY. She
    attended Kendall public schools for both elementary and high school.
    Her parents worked at Kendall Elementary School: her mother, Geraldine
    Corcoran, worked as an administrator, and Rudolph, her father, taught
    sixth grade. As a teenager, Kim played piano, bassoon, saxophone,
    and clarinet, and also performed as a drum major in her high-school
    marching band. She was a fan of the Beatles and other rock bands—to
    her father’s chagrin.</p>

    <p>After graduating high school in 1973, Kim attended the State
    University of New York at Oswego, where she majored in music education.
    She performed regularly on piano and gave private lessons while
    at college. She graduated Summa Cum Laude in 1977. After briefly
    attending a graduate program in Illinois, she moved to New York City
    at some point in 1978.</p>

    <p>Kim initially lived in Uptown Manhattan. She took dance classes
    near Times Square and occasionally tried out for parts at theatrical
    auditions. She worked various jobs, mostly in business administration.
    Always a fitness buff, Kim worked out regularly at various New York
    gyms. She entered several body-building competitions in the mid 1980s
    and won at least one first-place trophy. She jogged regularly and
    ran the New York City Marathon in 1982 and 1983.</p>

    <p>In 1983 she also became romantically involved with Donald Mathe,
    an artist and antique restorer she met while they were both working
    at Banner Press, a New York publishing house. They enjoyed traveling
    together; in August 1984 they performed a private marriage ceremony
    on a glacier in Switzerland, near the town of Mürren. Although they
    were never legally married, Kim and Donald lived together in NYC’s
    East Village from 1984 to 2011. Their first child, Wolfgang
    Corcoran-Mathe, was born in 1988, and their second, Bellisant
    Corcoran-Mathe, in 1993.</p>

    <p>In the late ’80s Kim began tutoring high-school students in math at
    the Brooklyn Learning Center in Park Slope, Brooklyn. She switched to
    freelance tutoring in the early 90’s and gradually built up an extensive
    clientele. She bought a bicycle in the mid ’90s and began cycling to
    her appointments. Kim adapted quickly to the intimidating streets of
    1990s New York City, becoming an accomplished city cyclist.</p>

    <p>Geraldine Corcoran died of cancer in 1995. The loss was hard for
    Kim, who had always been close to her mother.</p>

    <p>Kim was extremely busy in the late ’90s and 2000s. She supported her
    family with her tutoring business after her parter Donald’s antique
    restoration work dried up. She also taught at home: beginning in 1996,
    she and Donald home-schooled both of their children. In her limited
    free time, Kim studied flamenco, tap dance, and (briefly) bagpipes
    and accordion. She enjoyed dining out, and occasionally went to the
    Red Blazer, a 1940s-themed nightclub in Manhattan’s Midtown district,
    to dance to Frank Sinatra songs.</p>

    <p>In 2009 Kim’s father, Rudy, died of a stroke. Shortly afterward
    she and Donald divorced (extra-legally) and, in 2011, Kim moved back
    to her childhood home in Kendall. She repaired and redecorated her
    parents’ house extensively, making it her own.</p>

    <p>At first, Kim struggled to adjust to life in a rural area after years
    in NYC. She took up knitting and sewing and started a business selling
    her craft work online and at local fairs. She worked briefly at Wegmans,
    Kohl’s, and at a local real estate office. On some weekends she would
    fly to NYC and give a closely-packed series of tutoring sessions.</p>

    <p>Kim soon found things to do in the Kendall area. She founded
    the Kendall Lawn Chair Ladies, a comic color guard that performed
    at parades in Kendall and nearby towns. In 2013 she began hosting a
    Broadway radio show, “Two on the Aisle”, on Rochester’s Jazz 90.1 FM
    radio station. Initially a one-hour program on Sunday afternoons, it
    was extended to two hours in the late 2010s. She played songs from her
    favorite musicals and provided hammy but knowledgable commentary. She
    eventually broadcast over 300 episodes, and wrote over 1,400 posts on
    <a href="https://broadwayatitsbest.blogspot.com">the show’s companion
    blog</a>.</p>

    <p>In the mid 2010s Kim took up cycling again, and began to undertake
    long yearly trips. Cycling with a friend, she circumnavigated Lake
    Ontario in 2016, Lake Huron in 2017, Lake Erie in 2019, and Lake Michigan
    in 2020. During her last major bike trip, in summer 2023, she traveled
    from Kendall to Montreal, Canada, and back.</p>

    <p>While cycling near Albion, NY in the early morning of June 15th,
    2024, Kim apparently fell off her bike and suffered a severe head
    injury. She was taken to Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, NY and
    treated, but died on July 26th, 2024. She was 68. She is survived by
    her children, Wolfgang and Bellisant. Her ex-partner, Donald Mathe,
    died from complications with Parkinson’s Disease in 2021.</p>
