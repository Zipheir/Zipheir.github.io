    </div>

    <p>Kim Corcoran was born on Oct. 18, 1955 in Albion, NY and grew up in
    Kendall, a small town approximately 35 miles from Rochester, NY. She
    attended Kendall public schools for both elementary and high school.
    Her parents worked at Kendall Elementary School: her mother, Geraldine
    Corcoran, worked as an administrator, and Rudolph, her father, taught
    sixth grade. As a teenager, Kim played piano, bassoon, saxophone,
    and clarinet, and also performed as a drum major in her high-school
    marching band. She was a fan of the Beatles and other rock bands—to
    her father’s chagrin.</p>

    <p>After graduating high school in 1973, Kim attended the State
    University of New York at Oswego, where she majored in music education.
    She performed regularly on piano and gave private lessons while
    at college. She graduated Summa Cum Laude in 1977. After briefly
    attending a graduate program in Normal, Illinois (most likely at
    Illinois State University), she moved to New York City
    in late 1978.</p>

    <p>Kim initially shared an apartment with her boyfriend on 46th Street
    and 9th Avenue (in Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood).
    She took dance classes
    near Times Square and occasionally tried out for parts at theatrical
    auditions. She worked various jobs, mostly in business administration.
    Always a fitness buff, Kim worked out regularly at various New York
    gyms. She entered several body-building competitions in the mid 1980s
    and won at least one first-place trophy. She jogged regularly and
    ran the New York City Marathon in 1982 and 1983.</p>

    <p>In 1983 she also became romantically involved with Donald Mathe,
    an artist and antique restorer she met while they were both working
    at Banner Press, a New York publishing house. They enjoyed traveling
    together; in August 1984 they performed a private marriage ceremony
    on a glacier in Switzerland, near the town of Mürren. Although they
    were never legally married, Kim and Donald lived together in NYC’s
    East Village from 1984 to 2011. Their first child, Wolfgang
    Corcoran-Mathe, was born in 1988, and their second, Bellisant
    Corcoran-Mathe, in 1993.</p>

    <p>In the late ’80s Kim began tutoring high-school students in math at
    the Brooklyn Learning Center in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn.
    She switched to
    freelance tutoring in the early ’90s and gradually built up an extensive
    clientele. She bought a bicycle in the mid ’90s and began cycling to
    her appointments. Kim adapted quickly to the intimidating streets of
    1990s New York City, becoming an accomplished city cyclist.</p>

    <p>Geraldine Corcoran died of cancer in 1995. The loss was hard for
    Kim, who had always been close to her mother.</p>

    <p>Kim was extremely busy in the late ’90s and 2000s. She supported her
    family with her tutoring business after her partner Donald’s antique
    restoration work dried up. She also taught at home: beginning in 1996,
    she and Donald home-schooled both of their children. In her limited
    free time, Kim studied flamenco, tap dance, and (briefly) bagpipes
    and accordion. She enjoyed dining out, and occasionally went to the
    Red Blazer, a 1940s-themed nightclub in Manhattan’s Midtown district,
    to dance to Frank Sinatra songs.</p>

    <p>In 2009 Kim’s father, Rudy, died of a stroke. Shortly afterward
    she and Donald divorced (extra-legally) and, in 2011, Kim moved back
    to her childhood home in Kendall. She repaired and redecorated her
    parents’ house extensively, making it her own.</p>

    <p>At first, Kim struggled to adjust to life in a rural area after years
    in NYC. She took up knitting and sewing and started a business selling
    her craft work online and at local fairs. She worked briefly at Wegmans,
    Kohl’s, and at a local real estate office. On some weekends she would
    fly to NYC and give a closely-packed series of tutoring sessions.</p>

    <p>Kim soon found things to do in the Kendall area. She founded
    the Kendall Lawn Chair Ladies, a comic color guard that performed
    at parades in Kendall and nearby towns. In 2013 she began hosting a
    Broadway radio show, “Two on the Aisle”, on Rochester’s Jazz 90.1 FM
    radio station. Initially a one-hour program on Sunday afternoons, it
    was extended to two hours in the late 2010s. She played songs from her
    favorite musicals and provided hammy but knowledgeable commentary. She
    eventually broadcast over 300 episodes, and wrote over 1,400 posts on
    <a href="https://broadwayatitsbest.blogspot.com">the show’s companion
    blog</a>.</p>

    <p>In the mid 2010s Kim took up cycling again, and began to undertake
    long yearly trips. Cycling with a friend, she traveled the entire
    Erie Canal Trailway in 2015, then circumnavigated Lake
    Ontario in 2016, Lake Huron in 2017, Lake Erie in 2019, and Lake Michigan
    in 2020. During her last major bike trip, in summer 2023, she traveled
    from Kendall to Montreal, Canada, and back.</p>

    <p>While cycling near Albion, NY around 9 AM on June 15th,
    2024, Kim fell off her bike and suffered a severe head
    injury. She was taken to Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, NY and
    treated, but died on July 26th, 2024. She was 68. She is survived by
    her children, Wolfgang and Bellisant. Her ex-partner, Donald Mathe,
    died from complications with Parkinson’s Disease in 2021.</p>

    <h2>Kim in Her Own Words</h2>

    <p>The following biographical notes, from January 2021, were found
    in one of Kim’s personal files:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Personal story? This might go well with the pic of 3-year-old
      Kim dancing. :)</p>

      <p>I moved to NYC when I was 23. I had recently enrolled in grad
      school out in some place called Normal, Illinois (that name
      should have been a sign). After 1.5 rotten weeks of cornfields
      and bratwurst, I knew Illinois-annoying school wasn’t for
      me (that name shoulda been a sign!!!). So with about $60 in
      my pocket, and an 18 hour Amtrak ride ahead of me, I moved to
      Hell’s Kitchen, which is what the name for “Clinton” was at the
      time. 46th and 9th Avenue. To live with my boyfriend. Both the
      move and the move-in-together arrangement was scandalous to my
      parents. But thanks to the NYC economy, I had a temp job the
      day after I got there.</p>

      <p>Then I started dance lessons (well, I’d been tapping for 18
      years, but now I would enter the big leagues). Not the best
      dancer in the world, but I believed the old Broadway saw...that
      luck would bolster my lack of talent and make me a star. Three
      years of classes/auditions/and rejections (well, I DID get called
      back for a Best Little Whorehouse In Texas try out), I let the
      dream go (as well as the waitressing gigs) and met Reality. I
      stayed in New York City, if not with the boyfriend, for 33
      years.</p>

      <p>I’m still a sucky dancer, but excellent in Denial. A Broadway
      baby, if only in my own mind!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The following is a series of memoirs from a personal file last
    edited 20 March, 2023. The first section describes Kim’s childhood
    vacations in Black Lake, New York; the second, her decision to
    leave graduate school and to move to New York City; the third, her
    return to Kendall, New York in 2011, and her subsequent life there.
    The fourth section is incomplete. In early 2023, Kim nearly moved to
    Philadelphia, so it’s possible that she meant to write about her
    experiences after leaving Kendall.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h3>1</h3>

      <p>Every year, Black Lake. Destination, well not exactly the
      Adirondacks. Destination, the “foothills” of the Adirondacks.
      Much cheaper white and “Adirondack Green” cabins, little
      fishing boats you could rent…even motors if you didn’t have
      your own. No showers in those cabins. For that you had to use
      the little “shower house” plunked down in the middle of the
      camp. No laundry services (you brought enough). And no beach.
      Just down a hill to the docks where the tiny boats were moored.
      You either sunbathed on the docks or just jumped off them, but
      you’d better wear your old Keds, because a murky bottom and
      the occasional beer bottle might bite you. But you didn’t care.
      It was that summer vacation ether in the air.</p>

      <p>1 week a year. That was it. My frugal dad and mom were
      willing to pay $60 for 1 week’s rent for the cabin AND the
      boat, but no more. Grandpa and Grandma shared the cabin cost
      (sprung for their own boat), so let’s talk way cheap. Way frugal.
      Mom would bring cooking supplies from home. “Why buy coffee
      (or flour or sugar) from the locals if you can just shove it
      the Ford station wagon?” No TV. No radio. The kitchen/living
      area didn’t come with a couch. Just a big yellow chrome kitchen
      table and chair set (for nightly games of euchre). Two bedrooms,
      sectioned off from the main room with curtains for doors. BUT…</p>

      <p>A big screened-in porch. And a even bigger table. For outside
      breakfast, and rocking, and breathing the lake, and viewing
      sunrises. And an old fashioned toaster that I still carry a
      burn mark from. </p>

      <p>Did I miss a TV? Did I require friends my own age to play
      with ? No to the former, Yes to the latter. Sometimes I’d luck
      out and a family would rent another one of those cabins for
      the week, and I’d have a week-long new best friend to swim with
      and tell tales to. One time a family of 6 kids…the Skeletons!
      A herd of kids! And among them, Earl, age 10. Me, age 9, with
      a red and white nylon tricot swim suit. Best summer ever. Still
      have the photo. Somewhere.</p>

      <p>I did discover comic books there (The 3 Wives Of Superman!).
      And a Sunday newspaper that sported 2 score (or more) of
      cartoons. I learned to “pilot” that tiny fishing boat. I learned
      to clean fish, having caught dozens with mom and dad and g and
      g in our favorite fishing spots. I saw fireworks over the lake
      and heard military drills from across the lake in Fort Drum.
      I wrote my first love letters. I was “in vitro” on my first
      visit to Black Lake, and 19 years old on my last.</p>

      <p>Mom putting on lipstick in the tiny bathroom, before going
      fishing. “You never know who you’re going to meet!”</p>

      <p>My grandma falling in the lake trying to get in the boat
      from the dock. Her old fishing hat. The only week of the year
      when she’d wear pants!</p>

      <p>My dad and grandpa holding up a string of what seemed like 100
      perch and sunnies and bass after a banner day on the water.</p>

      <p>Reading The Forsythe Saga clean through in one week, sitting
      on a rock every day. I tried to re-read it a few years ago.
      One HUGE soap opera.</p>

      <p>And a light and airy feel of summer. Never found again.</p>


      <h3>2</h3>

      <p>I started dreaming/fantasizing about a life in NYC one summer
      in between college semesters. It was probably a combination
      of movie musicals and magazines feeding into that romantic
      side of my brain. Both sides actually. I remember “sunbathing”
      in the back yard, reading Cosmopolitan (what a rag to set your
      life pathway by…) and a.) finding out I was probably anorexic,
      and b.) that New York City was edgy and hip and every model
      there was probably anorexic, too. Just the place.</p>

      <p>It also provided an answer to what I’d be doing after
      graduation and where I’d do it. Despite the fact that I was
      getting a degree in education, I did NOT want to teach. I found
      that out a little too late in my college career to do much about
      it. So…. NYC could be a distraction for a few years, right? I
      could type my way into a secretarial job, take dance classes, and
      pretend to fit into New York life, at least for 2 or 3 years. I
      mean, wasn’t that a thing you were supposed to do in your youth,
      before “strings” attached to you like tentacles?</p>

      <p>But first I made the ridiculous decision to try grad
      school. Because someone out there in Illinois liked me and
      awarded me a fellowship. Loving external praise the way I do,
      I accepted. Should have read the signs. I had no money. I had
      no desire to move 1,000 miles away from my boyfriend, who was
      finishing out his senior year in college. Annnnnd after about
      3 days (literally), I quit. Embarrassing as hell, but my heart
      wasn’t into more education/research/practicing (piano)/teaching
      (piano) and missing said boyfriend. And then “the boyfriend”
      and his buddies decided to move to NYC. WHAT? Without me? No
      effing way. This was my chance. My opportunity to live there,
      with people I knew (and mostly loved). With $60 in my pocket,
      after that 24 hour train fare was paid for, and after shipping
      most of my stuff back to Kendall, I landed in Hell’s Kitchen
      in October of 1978. A duplex leased by one of the “friends.”
      We had the basement level, which came with roaches and crabs
      (an old mattress) free of charge.</p>

      <p>My parents didn’t understand (nor approve) of my reactive
      choice, knowing I was now living with a guy, giving up on higher
      education, and seemingly so so happy to be living far away from
      them IN AN EVIL CITY. I think they took it as a slap in the face.
      And indeed, it was sort of the beginning of a slow distancing
      from them emotionally, as well. I didn’t understand my move
      at that point, never really thought any of this out rationally,
      but convinced myself that this was just for a WHILE. Not a long
      term thing. Like it was Kim’s “year off”, and that I’d ultimately
      run back to my old rural existence. That I’d fail at this too,
      say uncle, and end up back in Rochester, working for the likes of
      Kodak, with digs in some suburban cul de sac. I was emotionally
      immature, or at least emotionally driven, afraid, and hoping
      to quell those fears with …what? Love? Jesus, I had no clue.</p>

      <p>I would leave NYC in 2011. Staying longer than any of that
      bunch of friends I moved down there with. Even the one native
      New Yorker left before I did. Somewhere along the way, I sort
      of (but not entirely) woke up.</p>


      <h3>3</h3>

      <p>Back in these digs.</p>

      <p>Back in the house I was raised in. Now, after 33.3 years
      in NYC. Why did I come back and what’s it like to live here.
      The cute little saying I tell everyone: It was like moving from
      Mercury (close to the Sun, hot, fast orbit) to Pluto. And Pluto
      is not a planet. Funny. That’s the cute way of telling it.</p>

      <p>But I knew all that moving in. I knew it would be an incredible
      change from a city that never sleeps to one that rolls up
      its sidewalks at 9pm (Wait! It doesn’t have sidewalks). But I
      very much needed solace. Country-quiet, country breezes (yes,
      I moved in in the summer, not the winter, when those breezes
      turn to gales), no noisy apartment neighbors, no overwhelm
      at stores and restaurants, a place to bike, a place to nap.
      And it was all mine. My paintings on the walls, my objet, my
      favorite foods. And my schedule, not something that had to be
      agreed upon or anyone to “check with” before making plans.</p>

      <p>First, of course, I changed as much as possible about this
      house, given my “budget” (note quotes: “budget” being the topic
      of another chapter)… to make it my own. New coat(s) of paint,
      new furniture, new curtains and rugs…a black topped driveway.
      A new furnace, new appliances, the first ever computer in this
      house…the first ever “stereo” and “speakers”. I sometimes have
      to remind myself that this house actually was the same place
      I grew up in, it seems to have changed that much.</p>

      <p>And things didn’t really go south until, well maybe it was that
      same 7 year itch people talk about happening to relationships.
      But yes, around the 7th year, those people made me itch. They
      were the major problem. I stopped wanting to do stuff with them.
      First, they were all “coupled”. Connected to another, while I
      was a lone entity. Or they were Republican. Or church goers.
      Or scared to adventure with me. The organizations I joined (or
      formed) started driving me crazy, because I had to deal with the
      people in them, or the people they were stapled to. So I started
      coping…with travel ($$$), biking away (long distances!), exercise,
      and shopping therapy. Living alone and living a life of avoidance
      (no to a lot of social stuff) made me cranky/bitter/pissed off/
      and ready to ESCAPE. The coping bandaids stopped working.</p>

      <p>I should use the present tense there. Because that’s the
      state I’m still in. And when I’m not cranky, I’m re-actively
      lunging to fantasy plans…like moving away. Only problem, I’d
      have to bring ME along with ME.</p>
