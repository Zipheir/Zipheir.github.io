<Riastradh> jcowan: how about LLL
<jcowan> Sorry, only 26^3 TLAs
...
<Riastradh> LLL is black magic, yes.
<Riastradh> I use it to sort my socks, personally.
<foof`> are your socks encrypted?
<Riastradh> that would be telling
<foof`> security through obscurity!
<Riastradh> security through axiom of sock choice
%
<Riastradh> jcowan: no I mean what is the evening star and why
<jcowan> The morning star, because identity holds necessarily if it holds at all.
<jcowan> I am a curious beast, being both a Quinean and a Kripkean.
%
<Riastradh> I am not a fixnum; I am a free initial object in the category of rings!
%
<jcowan> And then there's a recursion: to know yourself is to know that you know yourself, etc.
* elflng hms.
* elflng knows that he doesn't know himself and breaks on a halting paradox.
<jcowan> Oh, ignorance doesn't involve any loops at all!
<jcowan> Of course, in some places to claim ignorance may be seen as rather ... presumptuous.
<jcowan> "Really?  I've been here in the monastery ten years and haven't acquired enough ignorance worth mentioning!"

<Bunny351> Kooda: I have seen many posts about superficially comparing scheme
           implementations over the years, and it is always the same.
<Kooda> Bunny351: is it that important? We don't *have* to be the fastest best
        most incredible implementation
<sjamaan> We don't? :)
<Bunny351> WE DON'T???

<jcowan> Life is too short to spend it being spoon-fed at someone else's notion of what the max rate of information flow is.
%
<Riastradh> do you want to call (launch-the-missiles) when you
compile the program,
<Riastradh> or do you want to _generate_ a call to (launch-the-missiles)
when you compile the program, so that it can be executed later on
when you run the program?
<Riastradh> (This is a trick question, of course -- the only winning
move is not to play!  BUT, for the purposes of this exercise, we
will put ourselves into the deathwish mentality of a Cold War-style
regime of mutually assured destruction.)
%
<elflng> back when i was the product of all of your ages....
<jcowan> Now that's hardcore.
<elflng> no, hardcore is 'back when i was a sequential ackermann function of
your ages, in descending order'

* alaricsp imagines that if his relative-references-in-infinite-memory machine
  was combined with jcowan's extensible-registers-on-demand machine then it
  could traverse all of memory in O(log infinity) time rather than O(infinity)
  time, a definite improvement
%
<jcowan> I am well known for my arrogant humility.
%
<jcowan> ... But what I intended is simply to call char-whitespace? and ignore
        any character that satisfies it.
<Riastradh> ignore any white characters who just take up space, like
            jared kushner
<Zipheir> Riastradh: I don't think we're likely to encounter him in a base64
          string.  I hope not, at least.
<jcowan> Perhaps as an emoji.  Which will raise an error satisfying
         bytestring-error?.
%
<jcowan> tdammers: It was you who brought up cotalks.
<Riastradh> jcowan: you cobrought down cotalks without tdammers
<tdammers> what have I done!
<Riastradh> tdammers: what haven't you codone
%
<Riastradh> God created the NaNs; all else is the work of man.
%
<jcowan> I think I will extend my title in R7RS-large from "chief cook and bottle
         washer" to "chief cook, bottle washer, and cat herder".
* foof hisses
<jcowan> Relax, relax, I'm not herding *you*.

<Riastradh> In the lockpicking world, where there are many different kinds of
            locks and picking them takes some physical skill and training but
            also some randomness, there's a notion of a `confidence lock'.
<Riastradh> If you find yourself getting discouraged because a lock you thought
            you knew how to pick is resisting your efforts, you might start to
            question whether you're any good at it at all, and you might be
            tempted to give up.
<Riastradh> A `confidence lock' is a lock with a smaller number of pins that's
            very easy to pick.  When you get stuck like that, going back to a
            confidence lock -- and getting the immense satisfaction of that
            last *click* or just sudden lack of resistance in your tensioner
            -- can inspire your confidence again and get you back to it.

<sytse> ... he starts his academic class about software architecture
        with 'as a way of establishing the fact that I'm real, and that
        I've got street cred: I have like, 6 boxes running linux in my
        house right now'
<sytse> showoff, but fun :-)
<jcowan> If he had 6 Hurd boxen that would be really impressive.
<sytse> at least he doesn't start his lecture with his MCSEs ;-)

<alaricsp> SO I AM EXCITED
<alaricsp> WE WILL FIX THIS AND BE STRONGER FOR IT

<johnjay> wasamasa: i can't tell what you're thinking now after we hijacked the
          channel for homological algebra and books
<johnjay> i can only tell you... it was necessary

<danderson> #freenode is quite the party at the minute. Every sysadmin
cosplayer on earth is there designing decentralized networks on napkins.
%
<jcowan> I would say: gently encourage people to move to libera.chat
and get away from ragnarok and the Korean Empire.

<elflng> i have water coming out of my ceiling. this is a suboptimal state of affairs.
