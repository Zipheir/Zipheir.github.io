### Idea for an automaton-based nano-constructor board game

Players control a swarm (or swarms) of nanobot constructors and try
to shepherd them to create buildings, spaceships, or something else.
The nanobots can build by depositing their bodies to form layers
(like coral polyps), or maybe in a more traditional way.

Goal: The players must either finish some assigned projects before
game end or collect points for completing projects, achievements, etc.

The swarms are cellular automata which reproduce, move, and die
according to simple rules. the players "operate" these swarms
by placing different signal chemicals: "move", "build", "remove",
etc. commands are available. Birth and death rates can also be affected
this way.

Mutation: Mutations sometimes occur within swarms. The usual effect
of a mutation is uncontrolled nanobot duplication.  The players will
have to keep an eye out for this and deal with mutations when they
happen, probably by destroying the affected bots and some of the
surrounding swarm. (This would exact a temporary building efficiency
penalty.) A player could also try to *take advantage* of mutation,
either to try for a beneficial mutation (increased efficiency in one
action or another) or to try to damage another player's project.

Increasing the birth rate might allow a player to finish a task
quickly, but it would *also* increase the mutation rate.

Basic game loop: (1) Choose a new project (maybe--draw from a deck or
from a tableau, etc.). (2) Place chemical markers to guide your swarm.
(3) Execute the swarm's actions.

This could be a competitive or a cooperative game.
