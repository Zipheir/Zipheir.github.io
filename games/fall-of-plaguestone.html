<h1>The Fall Of Plaguestone - Game Journal</h1>

<h2>Session 1 (2020-05-06) <a name="session1"></a></h2>

<p>The PCs and their players are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asa Smith-Moseley Rogueman (elf rogue) &ndash; Audrey LoBue</li>
<li>Ezren (human wizard) &ndash; Bran Kamp</li>
<li>Friar Chip Of Dale (dwarf cleric) &ndash; Ned Allen</li>
<li>Xavier E. Kingston (half-elf trombone bard) &ndash; Tyler Beaulieu</li>
</ul>


<p>The scene:</p>

<blockquote><p>It has been three days since you left Elidir, climbing into
the back of one of Bort Bargith&rsquo;s wagons bound for the faraway
Andoran capital of Almas.  The smiling caravan master cut your
travel cost to only a handful of coppers, so long as you
promised to protect the wagons should any trouble arise.
Fortunately, your journey through the hinterlands of Isger has
been quiet, even if the ride itself has been far from comfortable.</p>

<p>As you broke camp this morning, Bort announced you should arrive
at the the town of Etran&rsquo;s Folly by nightfall, and he promised a
comfortable bed for the night as a reward for a long day&rsquo;s travel.
The caravan&rsquo;s teamsters shared a chuckle between them, trading
knowing glances and subtle nods, but soon enough you are on the
road again, the wagon bouncing and creaking along the uneven trail.</p></blockquote>

<p>The PCs started the campaign as hired protectors of Bort Bargith&rsquo;s caravan
train.  En route from Elidir to Almas, the caravan was pulling into the
remote farming town of Etran&rsquo;s Folly, late in the day.  The PCs suddenly
heard howls from the surrounding woods; the caravan was attacked by three
mangy wolves.  These wolves were soon joined by a larger wolf with acid
dripping from its mouth.  The party defeated the pack, though Friar Chip
was severely injured.  They were thanked and congratulated by Bort and
other members of the caravan.</p>

<p>XP: 150 per character</p>

<p>Items: None</p>

<h2>Session 2 (2020-05-13) <a name="session2"></a></h2>

<p>The PCs helped get the caravan started again after the wolf attack, and
made it into Etran&rsquo;s Folly, a rural farming town, around dusk.
On their way into town, they saw lots of run-down-looking thatch houses
and a large, flat rock called the Plaguestone in the town square.  The
wagons parked at the Feedmill, a largish inn in the center of town.  Bort,
the PCs' employer, invited them to dinner with him and told them many
tall tales of his journeys.  Around the time that dessert was being served,
a brawl broke out among the inn&rsquo;s regular crowd of farmers.  The PCs helped
calm things down.  Afterward, they rejoined Bort for dessert.  While eating
his turnip porridge, Bort started choking, passed out, and died a few
minutes later.  Chip was able to tell that he&rsquo;d been poisoned.  The local
sheriff, Rolth Garley, was brought to the Feedmill and began questioning
everyone.  He concluded by requesting everyone stay in town until the
regional magistrate, Lord Mubbage Cranberry, could arrive to sort things
out&mdash;likely in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The PCs went to an ad-hoc memorial service for Bort out in the stables
among the wagons.  Tamli, Bort&rsquo;s second-in-command, asked them solemnly to
find Bort&rsquo;s murderer.  She allowed them to search Bort&rsquo;s wagon; after
several hours studying Bort&rsquo;s records, Ezren and Xavier were able to find
some information about Bort&rsquo;s relationship with Etran&rsquo;s Folly: Bort had
visited the town many times, and had been bringing deliveries of &ldquo;reagents&rdquo;
to someone named &ldquo;H&rdquo; for the past five years.  These deliveries were
numbered 1 through 14; the most recent delivery happened earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Searching the grounds, Chip and Asa were also able to find a vial containing
a few drops of floral-smelling liquid, similar to a scent they noticed about
Bort&rsquo;s porridge-bowl.</p>

<p>The PCs camped out with the wagons, and agreed to begin following up on
their clues the next morning.</p>

<p>XP: 120 per character</p>

<p>Items: small glass vial, bloodstone (worth 5 gp).  Asa pocketed 7 sp
that he found on Bort&rsquo;s body.</p>

<h2>Session 3 (2020-05-20) <a name="session3"></a></h2>

<p>The party spoke to Delma, the owner of the Feedmill where the murder
occurred.  She asked them to spend some time with her father, the aged
mayor of Etran&rsquo;s Folly; in exchange, she offered them a reduced price
for room and board at the inn.  The PCs met the mayor, Targen Fulst,
and helped him lead them on a tour of the town.  They went through the
Dead Homes (the slums), saw an old &ldquo;druidic&rdquo; shrine along the Drunk
Shepard&rsquo;s Path, and the house ruins at Etran&rsquo;s Hill.  They had lunch
back at the Feedmill, and talked to Edra, the stablehand, afterward.
She told them she&rsquo;d seen several people leave the inn during the last
night&rsquo;s brawl, including Tamli and Phinick (both servers).  Edra asked
the PCs to retrieve some rosemary to use in a salve for the caravan&rsquo;s
newly flea-ridden horses.  They found this herb in grove near town
which was inhabited by a grumpy grizzly bear; they outwitted the bear,
and returned to Edra (at the Feedmill stables) with the ingredient.</p>

<p>XP: 200 per character</p>

<p>Items: n/a.  For helping Delma entertain her father, the PCs are
entitled to room and board at the Feedmill for 2 sp per night (per PC).</p>

<p>Other: Asa earned a Hero Point for his bear-outwitting acrobatics.</p>

<h2>Session 4 (2020-05-27) <a name="session4"></a></h2>

<p>After a lunch at the Feedmill, the PCs continued their investigation
of Bort&rsquo;s murder.  They talked to Flonk, the town bard, then visited the
Feedmill&rsquo;s cook, Amora, at her house by the orchard north of town.  They
fought off a bee swarm while approaching the house; Xavier was rather
badly stung.  Amora told Chip that she didn&rsquo;t see anyone unusual poking
around with Bort&rsquo;s dinner the previous night; she said that Phinick, the
(currently missing) goblin server plated it, and that Trin served it.
After this meeting, the PCs continued down the outskirt road to Trin&rsquo;s
house, south of town.  The helped save Trin&rsquo;s father from a wild boar,
then rested up for a while in her farmhouse.  Trin told them she left
during the fight at the Feedmill, during which she was hit with a mug.
She confirmed Amora&rsquo;s evidence regarding Bort&rsquo;s dessert: Phinick gave her
a plate, which she served.  Neither Amora nor Trin seemed to know
anything about Phinick&rsquo;s lodgings.</p>

<p>Walking back north through the town as dusk started to fall, the PCs
noticed a short figure creeping around behind some houses&hellip;</p>

<p>XP: 100 per character.  Chip earned 5 bonus XP for his careful
interviewing of witnesses.  Ezren earned 3 for his bee-roasting prowess,
and Asa, 3 for general competence.</p>

<p>Items: Turnip cakes from Amora.</p>

<h2>Session 5 (2020-06-03) <a name="session5"></a></h2>

<p>The party shadowed Phinick through the southern part of town, then
chased him across several areas when he noticed them and started
running.  The caught up with him in a turnip field, and questioned
him about his involvement in Bort&rsquo;s murder.  He told them that
Hallod, the local bruiser, had bullied him into adding the contents
of the vial of floral-smelling liquid to Bort&rsquo;s dessert.  Phinick
claimed that Hallod told him it was &ldquo;just some bitter herbs&rdquo; which
would make Bort sick, as payback for a bad deal Hallod made with
him.  Phinick was very frightened and told the PCs the whereabouts
of Hallod&rsquo;s house in the northern section of Etran&rsquo;s Folly.  Asa
helped Phinick get back to his temporary shelter in a house in the
Dead Homes section of town, then the party rested for the night at
the Feedmill.</p>

<p>In the morning, the PCs went to the north of town and dropped off
some food for Phinick.  Before leaving, Asa told Trin (server at
the Feedmill who seemed to be concerned about Phinick) that the
goblin was afraid for his safety and was laying low.  The PCs made
their way to Hallod&rsquo;s house, which appeared to be deserted and
partly collapsed.  They found a concealed entrance, and discovered
a crawlspace running under the ground floor of the house.  This
took them to a closet-like room with a door (apparently blocked
from the other side by debris) and a hatch leading to a chute with
stone walls.  The PCs went down this chute, after tying a rope to
the nearby doorknob.  They landed in a short stone hallway some 30
feet below the closet.  Opening a door at the other end of the
hallway, they entered a larger stone-floored, torch-lit room
containing some boxes and barrels, and a kennel area with an iron
gate.  They saw Hallod watching them through a grated door at the
far end of the room; a moment later, the kennel gate began to open.
They quickly defeated Hallod&rsquo;s four guard dogs.  Asa spent the fight
opening the grated door, and sprinted after Hallod once it was open.</p>

<p>XP: 210 per character.  Asa got a bonus of 10 XP for doing extensive
trap handling.  Ezren got 5 bonus XP for making creative use of his
evocation spells when chasing Phinick.</p>

<p>Items: None.</p>

<h2>Session 6 (2020-06-17) <a name="session6"></a></h2>

<p>The PCs pursued Hallod through some basement chambers that comprised
his home, and into a series of natural cave tunnels.  Chip hung
back and grabbed a strongbox which he found stashed under Hallod&rsquo;s
cot.  They defeated a lightning serpent belonging to Hallod in a
cavern during their pursuit, then found Hallod waiting for them in
a larger cave mouth opening to the surface.  They fought Hallod in
this cave and knocked him unconscious, although Xavier was seriously
wounded during the fight.  In Hallod&rsquo;s pockets, the PCs found the
key to his strongbox and a letter containing the following text:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hallod,</p>

<p>The final shipment of corpse blood is due in just over a week, and
it is the last thing I need from that greedy bastard, Bort. I&rsquo;ve
enclosed a parting gift for him that should ensure he never tells
anyone of our dealings. Be sure that he gets it, my darling.</p>

<p>Drop off the reagents as soon as they arrive. My work is almost
done. You will find your usual reward in the stump. &mdash;V</p></blockquote>

<p>In the cave mouth where Hallod launched his ambush, the PCs found
several heavy chests of alchemical reagents, which Ezren appraised
to be worth around 50 gp.  Having stabilized and bound Hallod, they
made their way back through the caves to his chambers and made a
thorough search.  Asa opened his strongbox and found receipts
matching the transaction records from Bort&rsquo;s caravan, as well as a
crude map showing the location of the stump used by Hallod and &ldquo;V&rdquo;
as a drop-off point.  Chip dug through some trash and discovered a
number of small glass bottles, all alike, containing an acrid-smelling
silvery residue.  Asa returned to Hallod&rsquo;s kennel and befriended the
remaining guard dog.</p>

<p>The party returned to town with the restrained Hallod, and turned him
over to the sheriff (Rolth) along with the receipts found in his
strongbox.  They then returned to the Feedmill for dinner and a full
night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>

<p>XP: 282 XP per character.  Asa got 10 bonus XP for befriending and
rescuing Hallod&rsquo;s former guard dog.  Ezren got 10 XP for quickly
adminstering aid to Xavier.  Xavier got 5 for hanging in despite
almost dying.  Chip got 3 for digging through Hallod&rsquo;s garbage piles.</p>

<p>Xavier also earned a hero point.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Session 7 (2020-06-24) <a name="session7"></a></h2>

<p>The session began with the party resting for the night at the Feedmill.
In the morning, they had breakfast, then set out to talk to Hallod (whom
they left with Rolth, the sheriff) and to find the stump where Hallod
was dropping reagents for &ldquo;V&rdquo;.  In the center of town, they were
approached by a hooded woman pulling a wooden sledge carrying several
wolf carcases&mdash;the same wolves the PCs killed in the first session.
She introduced herself as Noala Kesrir, a ranger who has been caring for
the lands around Etran&rsquo;s Folly, and asked the PCs if they were the ones
who killed the wolves.  The PCs eventually told her the story of the
wolf attack on their caravan.  She told them the wolves were &ldquo;blighted&rdquo;,
and that other wildlife she&rsquo;d seen in the area were suffering from the
same disease.  She asked for the party&rsquo;s help, and they agreed to meet
her north of the town.</p>

<p>The PCs interviewed Hallod, and learned the full name of &ldquo;V&rdquo;&mdash;Vilree.
Hallod told them that Vilree once lived in town, that she was doing
&ldquo;important work&rdquo;, and that he hadn&rsquo;t seen her in at least a year.
The PCs also talked to the customers in the Feedmill&rsquo;s dining room,
seeking information about Vilree; one elderly farmer mentioned that he
recalled a &ldquo;clever elf lady&rdquo; by that name who spent time in Etran&rsquo;s
Folly, but wasn&rsquo;t clear on when.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the PCs visited Hallod&rsquo;s drop-off stump, but found only
some tracks made by Hallod himself.  They then set off to meet Noala.
They found her preparing to burn the wolf carcasses she&rsquo;d been dragging.
She repeated her request for help: not knowing the source or cause of
the spreading blight, she desperately needs help in investigating it.</p>

<p>XP: None.</p>

<p>Items: None.</p>

<h2>Session 8 (2020-07-01) <a name="session8"></a></h2>

<p>The PCs agreed to follow Noala to &ldquo;one of the smaller blights&rdquo;, a den
about three hours' march from Etran&rsquo;s Folly where she believed the
wolves that attack the party&rsquo;s caravan came from.  The party first
returned to town to rest for the evening.  At the Feedmill, they met
Targen Fulst (the mayor) and joined him for dinner.  He told them that
he&rsquo;d remembered some things about the name &ldquo;Vilree&rdquo;: During the plague
that struck the Etran&rsquo;s Folly region 20 years ago, the local priest of
Saranrae, Bolgrist, accused a &ldquo;clever woman&rdquo; named Silwyth of starting
the plague.  Silwyth and Bolgrist both eventually died of the plague,
but Silwyth&rsquo;s daughter, Vilree, left the town when her mother died and
was not heard from again.</p>

<p>The PCs met Noala outside of town early the next morning and began the
march to the blighted forest area.  During the trip, they spotted a
stash of items, including some gems wrapped in a crumbling poster
offering a reward for &ldquo;the witch Silwyth&rdquo;.  The party and Noala reached
the blight around midday.  Noala left the party to set up traps to keep
any other blighted animals from leaving the area.  The PCs defeated some
bloodlash bushes in a clearing near the center of the blight, then
proceeded toward the mud-tunnel entrance of some kind of den.</p>

<p>XP: 150 per character</p>

<p>Items: Lesser antidote, old poster, four gems (tiger&rsquo;s eye, alabaster,
lapis, sardonyx)</p>

<h2>Session 9 (2020-07-08) <a name="session9"></a></h2>

<p>The party sent Chip to investigate the den.  He found a large, slightly
luminous pool of sludgy water, the body of a large wolf, and two
diseased-looking live wolves.  He took a sample of the pool water and
returned to the party, but they were unable to learn much from the water
sample.  They called Noala, who asked them to dispose of the two
remaining wolves.  The PCs forced the wolves out of their den and
defeated them.  Afterwards, they investigated the den fully, and
discovered that the pool originated from an underground source, and was
heavily polluted with alchemical materials which had likely caused the
mutations in the wolves.</p>

<p>The PCs passed this news to Noala, who had killed two other wolves while
the PCs were investigating the den.  She said that she did not know of
any nearby wells that could be the source of the alchemical pollution.
She asked the PCs to accompany her to the oldest blight in these woods,
a large area which she has yet to explore thoroughly.  The party agreed
to join her the next morning, and made their way back to Etran&rsquo;s Folly
to rest for the night.</p>

<p>XP: 150 per character.  Chip gets 10 bonus XP for exploring the den on
his own.</p>
