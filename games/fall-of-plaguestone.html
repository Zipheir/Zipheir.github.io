<h1>The Fall Of Plaguestone - Game Journal</h1>

<h2>Session 1 (2020-05-06)</h2>

<blockquote><p>It has been three days since you left Elidir, climbing into
the back of one of Bort Bargith&rsquo;s wagons bound for the faraway
Andoran capital of Almas.  The smiling caravan master cut your
travel cost to only a handful of coppers, so long as you
promised to protect the wagons should any trouble arise.
Fortunately, your journey through the hinterlands of Isger has
been quiet, even if the ride itself has been far from comfortable.</p>

<p>As you broke camp this morning, Bort announced you should arrive
at the the town of Etran&rsquo;s Folly by nightfall, and he promised a
comfortable bed for the night as a reward for a long day&rsquo;s travel.
The caravan&rsquo;s teamsters shared a chuckle between them, trading
knowing glances and subtle nods, but soon enough you are on the
road again, the wagon bouncing and creaking along the uneven trail.</p></blockquote>

<p>The PCs started the campaign as hired protectors of Bort Bargith&rsquo;s caravan
train.  En route from Elidir to Almas, the caravan was pulling into the
remote farming town of Etran&rsquo;s Folly, late in the day.  The PCs suddenly
heard howls from the surrounding woods; the caravan was attacked by three
mangy wolves.  These wolves were soon joined by a larger wolf with acid
dripping from its mouth.  The party defeated the pack, though Friar Chip
was severely injured.  They were thanked and congratulated by Bort and
other members of the caravan.</p>
