<h1>The Fall Of Plaguestone - Game Journal</h1>

<h2>Session 1 (2020-05-06)</h2>

<p>The PCs started the campaign as hired protectors of Bort Bargith&rsquo;s caravan
train.  En route from Elidir to Almas, the caravan was pulling into the
remote farming town of Etran&rsquo;s Folly, late in the day.  The PCs suddenly
heard howls from the surrounding woods; the caravan was attacked by three
mangy wolves.  These wolves were soon joined by a larger wolf with acid
dripping from its mouth.  The party defeated the pack, though Friar Chip
was severely injured.  They were thanked and congratulated by Bort and
other members of the caravan.</p>
