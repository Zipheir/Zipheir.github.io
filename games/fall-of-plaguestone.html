<h1>The Fall Of Plaguestone - Game Journal</h1>

<h2>Session 1 (2020-05-06) <a name="session1"></a></h2>

<p>The PCs and their players are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asa Smith-Moseley Rogueman (elf rogue) &ndash; Audrey LoBue</li>
<li>Ezren (human wizard) &ndash; Bran Kamp</li>
<li>Friar Chip Of Dale (dwarf cleric) &ndash; Ned Allen</li>
<li>Xavier E. Kingston (half-elf trombone bard) &ndash; Tyler Beaulieu</li>
</ul>


<p>The scene:</p>

<blockquote><p>It has been three days since you left Elidir, climbing into
the back of one of Bort Bargith&rsquo;s wagons bound for the faraway
Andoran capital of Almas.  The smiling caravan master cut your
travel cost to only a handful of coppers, so long as you
promised to protect the wagons should any trouble arise.
Fortunately, your journey through the hinterlands of Isger has
been quiet, even if the ride itself has been far from comfortable.</p>

<p>As you broke camp this morning, Bort announced you should arrive
at the the town of Etran&rsquo;s Folly by nightfall, and he promised a
comfortable bed for the night as a reward for a long day&rsquo;s travel.
The caravan&rsquo;s teamsters shared a chuckle between them, trading
knowing glances and subtle nods, but soon enough you are on the
road again, the wagon bouncing and creaking along the uneven trail.</p></blockquote>

<p>The PCs started the campaign as hired protectors of Bort Bargith&rsquo;s caravan
train.  En route from Elidir to Almas, the caravan was pulling into the
remote farming town of Etran&rsquo;s Folly, late in the day.  The PCs suddenly
heard howls from the surrounding woods; the caravan was attacked by three
mangy wolves.  These wolves were soon joined by a larger wolf with acid
dripping from its mouth.  The party defeated the pack, though Friar Chip
was severely injured.  They were thanked and congratulated by Bort and
other members of the caravan.</p>

<p>Items: None</p>

<h2>Session 2 (2020-05-13) <a name="session2"></a></h2>

<p>The PCs helped get the caravan started again after the wolf attack, and
made it into Etran&rsquo;s Folly, a rural farming town, around dusk.
On their way into town, they saw lots of run-down-looking thatch houses
and a large, flat rock called the Plaguestone in the town square.  The
wagons parked at the Feedmill, a largish inn in the center of town.  Bort,
the PCs' employer, invited them to dinner with him and told them many
tall tales of his journeys.  Around the time that dessert was being served,
a brawl broke out among the inn&rsquo;s regular crowd of farmers.  The PCs helped
calm things down.  Afterward, they rejoined Bort for dessert.  While eating
his turnip porridge, Bort started choking, passed out, and died a few
minutes later.  Chip was able to tell that he&rsquo;d been poisoned.  The local
sheriff, Rolth Garley, was brought to the Feedmill and began questioning
everyone.  He concluded by requesting everyone stay in town until the
regional magistrate, Lord Mubbage Cranberry, could arrive to sort things
out&ndash;likely in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The PCs went to an ad-hoc memorial service for Bort out in the stables
among the wagons.  Tamli, Bort&rsquo;s second-in-command, asked them solemnly to
find Bort&rsquo;s murderer.  She allowed them to search Bort&rsquo;s wagon; after
several hours studying Bort&rsquo;s records, Ezren and Xavier were able to find
some information about Bort&rsquo;s relationship with Etran&rsquo;s Folly: Bort had
visited the town many times, and had been bringing deliveries of &ldquo;reagents&rdquo;
to someone named &ldquo;H&rdquo; for the past five years.  These deliveries were
numbered 1 through 14; the most recent delivery happened earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Searching the grounds, Chip and Asa were also able to find a vial containing
a few drops of floral-smelling liquid, similar to a scent the noticed about
Bort&rsquo;s porridge-bowl.</p>

<p>The PCs camped out with the wagons, and agreed to begin following up on
their clues the next morning.</p>

<p>XP: 120 per character</p>

<p>Items: small glass vial.  Asa pocketed 7 sp that he found on Bort&rsquo;s body.</p>
