# The Fall Of Plaguestone - Game Journal

## Session 1 (2020-05-06) <a name="session1"></a>

The PCs and their players are:

* Asa Smith-Moseley Rogueman (elf rogue) -- Audrey LoBue
* Ezren (human wizard) -- Bran Kamp
* Friar Chip Of Dale (dwarf cleric) -- Ned Allen
* Axel (human fighter) or Xavier E. Kingston (half-elf bard)
  -- Tyler Beaulieu

The scene:

> It has been three days since you left Elidir, climbing into
> the back of one of Bort Bargith's wagons bound for the faraway
> Andoran capital of Almas.  The smiling caravan master cut your
> travel cost to only a handful of coppers, so long as you
> promised to protect the wagons should any trouble arise.
> Fortunately, your journey through the hinterlands of Isger has
> been quiet, even if the ride itself has been far from comfortable.
>
> As you broke camp this morning, Bort announced you should arrive
> at the the town of Etran's Folly by nightfall, and he promised a
> comfortable bed for the night as a reward for a long day's travel.
> The caravan's teamsters shared a chuckle between them, trading
> knowing glances and subtle nods, but soon enough you are on the
> road again, the wagon bouncing and creaking along the uneven trail.

The PCs started the campaign as hired protectors of Bort Bargith's caravan
train.  En route from Elidir to Almas, the caravan was pulling into the
remote farming town of Etran's Folly, late in the day.  The PCs suddenly
heard howls from the surrounding woods; the caravan was attacked by three
mangy wolves.  These wolves were soon joined by a larger wolf with acid
dripping from its mouth.  The party defeated the pack, though Friar Chip
was severely injured.  They were thanked and congratulated by Bort and
other members of the caravan.

XP: 150 per character

Items: None


## Session 2 (2020-05-13) <a name="session2"></a>

The PCs helped get the caravan started again after the wolf attack, and
made it into Etran's Folly, a rural farming town, around dusk.
On their way into town, they saw lots of run-down-looking thatch houses
and a large, flat rock called the Plaguestone in the town square.  The
wagons parked at the Feedmill, a largish inn in the center of town.  Bort,
the PCs' employer, invited them to dinner with him and told them many
tall tales of his journeys.  Around the time that dessert was being served,
a brawl broke out among the inn's regular crowd of farmers.  The PCs helped
calm things down.  Afterward, they rejoined Bort for dessert.  While eating
his turnip porridge, Bort started choking, passed out, and died a few
minutes later.  Chip was able to tell that he'd been poisoned.  The local
sheriff, Rolth Garley, was brought to the Feedmill and began questioning
everyone.  He concluded by requesting everyone stay in town until the
regional magistrate, Lord Mubbage Cranberry, could arrive to sort things
out---likely in a few weeks.

The PCs went to an ad-hoc memorial service for Bort out in the stables
among the wagons.  Tamli, Bort's second-in-command, asked them solemnly to
find Bort's murderer.  She allowed them to search Bort's wagon; after
several hours studying Bort's records, Ezren and Xavier were able to find
some information about Bort's relationship with Etran's Folly: Bort had
visited the town many times, and had been bringing deliveries of "reagents"
to someone named "H" for the past five years.  These deliveries were
numbered 1 through 14; the most recent delivery happened earlier in the day.

Searching the grounds, Chip and Asa were also able to find a vial containing
a few drops of floral-smelling liquid, similar to a scent they noticed about
Bort's porridge-bowl.

The PCs camped out with the wagons, and agreed to begin following up on
their clues the next morning.

XP: 120 per character

Items: small glass vial, bloodstone (worth 5 gp).  Asa pocketed 7 sp
that he found on Bort's body.


## Session 3 (2020-05-20) <a name="session3"></a>

The party spoke to Delma, the owner of the Feedmill where the murder
occurred.  She asked them to spend some time with her father, the aged
mayor of Etran's Folly; in exchange, she offered them a reduced price
for room and board at the inn.  The PCs met the mayor, Targen Fulst,
and helped him lead them on a tour of the town.  They went through the
Dead Homes (the slums), saw an old "druidic" shrine along the Drunk
Shepard's Path, and the house ruins at Etran's Hill.  They had lunch
back at the Feedmill, and talked to Edra, the stablehand, afterward.
She told them she'd seen several people leave the inn during the last
night's brawl, including Tamli and Phinick (both servers).  Edra asked
the PCs to retrieve some rosemary to use in a salve for the caravan's
newly flea-ridden horses.  They found this herb in grove near town
which was inhabited by a grumpy grizzly bear; they outwitted the bear,
and returned to Edra (at the Feedmill stables) with the ingredient.

XP: 200 per character

Items: n/a.  For helping Delma entertain her father, the PCs are
entitled to room and board at the Feedmill for 2 sp per night (per PC).

Other: Asa earned a Hero Point for his bear-outwitting acrobatics.


## Session 4 (2020-05-27) <a name="session4"></a>

After a lunch at the Feedmill, the PCs continued their investigation
of Bort's murder.  They talked to Flonk, the town bard, then visited the
Feedmill's cook, Amora, at her house by the orchard north of town.  They
fought off a bee swarm while approaching the house; Xavier was rather
badly stung.  Amora told Chip that she didn't see anyone unusual poking
around with Bort's dinner the previous night; she said that Phinick, the
(currently missing) goblin server plated it, and that Trin served it.
After this meeting, the PCs continued down the outskirt road to Trin's
house, south of town.  The helped save Trin's father from a wild boar,
then rested up for a while in her farmhouse.  Trin told them she left
during the fight at the Feedmill, during which she was hit with a mug.
She confirmed Amora's evidence regarding Bort's dessert: Phinick gave her
a plate, which she served.  Neither Amora nor Trin seemed to know
anything about Phinick's lodgings.

Walking back north through the town as dusk started to fall, the PCs
noticed a short figure creeping around behind some houses...

XP: 100 per character.  Chip earned 5 bonus XP for his careful
interviewing of witnesses.  Ezren earned 3 for his bee-roasting prowess,
and Asa, 3 for general competence.

Items: Turnip cakes from Amora.


## Session 5 (2020-06-03) <a name="session5"></a>

The party shadowed Phinick through the southern part of town, then
chased him across several areas when he noticed them and started
running.  The caught up with him in a turnip field, and questioned
him about his involvement in Bort's murder.  He told them that
Hallod, the local bruiser, had bullied him into adding the contents
of the vial of floral-smelling liquid to Bort's dessert.  Phinick
claimed that Hallod told him it was "just some bitter herbs" which
would make Bort sick, as payback for a bad deal Hallod made with
him.  Phinick was very frightened and told the PCs the whereabouts
of Hallod's house in the northern section of Etran's Folly.  Asa
helped Phinick get back to his temporary shelter in a house in the
Dead Homes section of town, then the party rested for the night at
the Feedmill.

In the morning, the PCs went to the north of town and dropped off
some food for Phinick.  Before leaving, Asa told Trin (server at
the Feedmill who seemed to be concerned about Phinick) that the
goblin was afraid for his safety and was laying low.  The PCs made
their way to Hallod's house, which appeared to be deserted and
partly collapsed.  They found a concealed entrance, and discovered
a crawlspace running under the ground floor of the house.  This
took them to a closet-like room with a door (apparently blocked
from the other side by debris) and a hatch leading to a chute with
stone walls.  The PCs went down this chute, after tying a rope to
the nearby doorknob.  They landed in a short stone hallway some 30
feet below the closet.  Opening a door at the other end of the
hallway, they entered a larger stone-floored, torch-lit room
containing some boxes and barrels, and a kennel area with an iron
gate.  They saw Hallod watching them through a grated door at the
far end of the room; a moment later, the kennel gate began to open.
They quickly defeated Hallod's four guard dogs.  Asa spent the fight
opening the grated door, and sprinted after Hallod once it was open.

XP: 210 per character.  Asa got a bonus of 10 XP for doing extensive
trap handling.  Ezren got 5 bonus XP for making creative use of his
evocation spells when chasing Phinick.

Items: None.


## Session 6 (2020-06-17) <a name="session6"></a>

The PCs pursued Hallod through some basement chambers that comprised
his home, and into a series of natural cave tunnels.  Chip hung
back and grabbed a strongbox which he found stashed under Hallod's
cot.  They defeated a lightning serpent belonging to Hallod in a
cavern during their pursuit, then found Hallod waiting for them in
a larger cave mouth opening to the surface.  They fought Hallod in
this cave and knocked him unconscious, although Xavier was seriously
wounded during the fight.  In Hallod's pockets, the PCs found the
key to his strongbox and a letter containing the following text:

> Hallod,
>
> The final shipment of corpse blood is due in just over a week, and
> it is the last thing I need from that greedy bastard, Bort. I've
> enclosed a parting gift for him that should ensure he never tells
> anyone of our dealings. Be sure that he gets it, my darling.
>
> Drop off the reagents as soon as they arrive. My work is almost
> done. You will find your usual reward in the stump. ---V

In the cave mouth where Hallod launched his ambush, the PCs found
several heavy chests of alchemical reagents, which Ezren appraised
to be worth around 50 gp.  Having stabilized and bound Hallod, they
made their way back through the caves to his chambers and made a
thorough search.  Asa opened his strongbox and found receipts
matching the transaction records from Bort's caravan, as well as a
crude map showing the location of the stump used by Hallod and "V"
as a drop-off point.  Chip dug through some trash and discovered a
number of small glass bottles, all alike, containing an acrid-smelling
silvery residue.  Asa returned to Hallod's kennel and befriended the
remaining guard dog.

The party returned to town with the restrained Hallod, and turned him
over to the sheriff (Rolth) along with the receipts found in his
strongbox.  They then returned to the Feedmill for dinner and a full
night's sleep.

XP: 282 XP per character.  Asa got 10 bonus XP for befriending and
rescuing Hallod's former guard dog.  Ezren got 10 XP for quickly
adminstering aid to Xavier.  Xavier got 5 for hanging in despite
almost dying.  Chip got 3 for digging through Hallod's garbage piles.

Xavier also earned a hero point.

### Items

* 2 vials of Lesser Alchemist's Fire
* Coin purse containing 2 gp, 8 sp, 14 cp
* Strongbox containing receipts, a map, 21 gp, and 37 sp
* Letter from "V" to Hallod
* Several crates of alchemical reagents, worth about 50 gp
* Runestone containing the Shadow rune
* 2 everburning torches
* Miscellaneous: rope, whetstone, dagger, candles, empty mutagen
  bottles, various food and cheap ale.

* Leather armor
* Lesser juggernaut mutagen
* Strongbox key

## Session 7 (2020-06-24) <a name="session7"></a>

The session began with the party resting for the night at the Feedmill.
In the morning, they had breakfast, then set out to talk to Hallod (whom
they left with Rolth, the sheriff) and to find the stump where Hallod
was dropping reagents for "V".  In the center of town, they were
approached by a hooded woman pulling a wooden sledge carrying several
wolf carcases---the same wolves the PCs killed in the first session.
She introduced herself as Noala Kesrir, a ranger who has been caring for
the lands around Etran's Folly, and asked the PCs if they were the ones
who killed the wolves.  The PCs eventually told her the story of the
wolf attack on their caravan.  She told them the wolves were "blighted",
and that other wildlife she'd seen in the area were suffering from the
same disease.  She asked for the party's help, and they agreed to meet
her north of the town.

The PCs interviewed Hallod, and learned the full name of "V"---Vilree.
Hallod told them that Vilree once lived in town, that she was doing
"important work", and that he hadn't seen her in at least a year.
The PCs also talked to the customers in the Feedmill's dining room,
seeking information about Vilree; one elderly farmer mentioned that he
recalled a "clever elf lady" by that name who spent time in Etran's
Folly, but wasn't clear on when.

Afterwards, the PCs visited Hallod's drop-off stump, but found only
some tracks made by Hallod himself.  They then set off to meet Noala.
They found her preparing to burn the wolf carcasses she'd been dragging.
She repeated her request for help: not knowing the source or cause of
the spreading blight, she desperately needs help in investigating it.

XP: None.

Items: None.


## Session 8 (2020-07-01) <a name="session8"></a>

The PCs agreed to follow Noala to "one of the smaller blights", a den
about three hours' march from Etran's Folly where she believed the
wolves that attack the party's caravan came from.  The party first
returned to town to rest for the evening.  At the Feedmill, they met
Targen Fulst (the mayor) and joined him for dinner.  He told them that
he'd remembered some things about the name "Vilree": During the plague
that struck the Etran's Folly region 20 years ago, the local priest of
Saranrae, Bolgrist, accused a "clever woman" named Silwyth of starting
the plague.  Silwyth and Bolgrist both eventually died of the plague,
but Silwyth's daughter, Vilree, left the town when her mother died and
was not heard from again.

The PCs met Noala outside of town early the next morning and began the
march to the blighted forest area.  During the trip, they spotted a
stash of items, including some gems wrapped in a crumbling poster
offering a reward for "the witch Silwyth".  The party and Noala reached
the blight around midday.  Noala left the party to set up traps to keep
any other blighted animals from leaving the area.  The PCs defeated some
bloodlash bushes in a clearing near the center of the blight, then
proceeded toward the mud-tunnel entrance of some kind of den.

XP: 150 per character

Items: Lesser antidote, old poster, four gems (tiger's eye, alabaster,
lapis, sardonyx)


## Session 9 (2020-07-08) <a name="session9"></a>

The party sent Chip to investigate the den.  He found a large, slightly
luminous pool of sludgy water, the body of a large wolf, and two
diseased-looking live wolves.  He took a sample of the pool water and
returned to the party, but they were unable to learn much from the water
sample.  They called Noala, who asked them to dispose of the two
remaining wolves.  The PCs forced the wolves out of their den and
defeated them.  Afterwards, they investigated the den fully, and
discovered that the pool originated from an underground source, and was
heavily polluted with alchemical materials which had likely caused the
mutations in the wolves.

The PCs passed this news to Noala, who had killed two other wolves while
the PCs were investigating the den.  She said that she did not know of
any nearby wells that could be the source of the alchemical pollution.
She asked the PCs to accompany her to the oldest blight in these woods,
a large area which she has yet to explore thoroughly.  The party agreed
to join her the next morning, and made their way back to Etran's Folly
to rest for the night.

XP: 150 per character.  Chip gets 10 bonus XP for exploring the den on
his own.


## Session 10 (2020-07-15) <a name="session10"></a>

The PCs settled their bills at the Feedmill and Xavier gave a concert.
After resting for the night, they set off first thing in the morning.
Meeting Noala north of town, they began a long march to what she
described as the biggest and oldest blight in the forest.  The trip
was uneventful, and the PCs decided to camp for the night on the outskirts
of the blight.

Early the following morning, they entered the blight.  Passing through
two tiers of increasingly damaged forest, they found a large area in the
center of the blight where the plants and insects were strangely altered.
Chip found boot tracks, which the PCs were able to follow to the foot of
a hill deep in the blight, surrounded by a high hedge of brambles.  They
defeated some animate bush creatures blocking the path, and found an
entrance in the hedge.  They entered a yard in which two orcs were pouring
buckets of liquid into a pool of extremely toxic-looking sludge.  They
quickly defeated the orcs and the cages in the yard.  In one, a barricaded
cave, they found a leopard which seemed to be burning, via some kind of
alchemical treatment.  They were able to give it some chilled water and
treat its whip wounds.

After helping the fiery leopard, the party entered a passage on the other
side of the yard, leading into the heart of the hill.  They soon entered
a torch-lit cavern full of cauldrons and tables covered in alchemical
equipment and components, as well as two orcs at one of the cauldrons.
These alchemists attacked the PCs as soon as they entered the
laboratory-cavern; the PCs defeated them, then began to explore the lab.

XP: 260 plus 10 bonus XP to everyone.

Items:

* Javelins (6)
* Orc knuckle daggers (4)
* Minor elixir of life (3)
* Lesser bottled lightning (2)
* Lesser acid flask
* Shoddy breastplate (2)

These were all found on the various orcs that the party defeated, and
have not necessarily been picked up yet.


## Session 11 (2020-07-22) <a name="session11"></a>

The PCs entered the deepest chambers of the laboratory and found a well-lit
room full of alchemical equipment.  Here, an orc in lab gear attacked them.
After a brief skirmish, he opened a door to a large chamber and ran in.
The PCs followed him and found him next to a human bound to a table; the
alchemist sprinkled a red powder around the human, and a large ooze made
of the victim's blood burst out of the body.  The party fought the ooze,
then chased down the alchemist, who attempted to flee through a secret
door.

XP: Approx. 355 (enough to level up) to everyone.

Items: n/a (several potions which the party used in the course of game.)


## Session 12 (2020-07-29) <a name="session12"></a>

The PCs finished investigate the hidden laboratory.  The found extensive
notes written by the chief alchemist, detailing many experiments performed
by him and his assistants for Vilree.  Studying the notes, they found that
Vilree had recently stopped ordering experiments to be performed.

After making the long trek back to Etran's Folly, the party arrived at the
Feedmill to rest for the night.  In the taproom, they were hailed by a
strange party of goblins, who demanded 5 sp from each member of the party.
Ezren had "a better offer", striking the lead goblin and one of his
companions with an electric arc.  The party quickly defeated the goblins,
and were given a weapon potency runestone as a reward from Delma.

XP: 60 per character

Items: TODO

## Session 13 (2020-08-05) <a name="session13"></a>

After spending a couple of days in town preparing, the party set off
toward Spite's Cradle (the laboratory indicated on a map they found at
the lab they just investigated).  Traveling by horse, they skirted the
forest surrounding Etran's Folly and, following their map, headed toward
the Five Kings Mountains.  They reached the foothills of these mountains
near dark, and camped for the night.

The next morning, they continued, entered a valley, and soon came to a
large wooden palisade wall.  Asa climbed over and entered a courtyard
guarded by several orc warriors; he opened the gate and let the rest of
the party into the yard.  They fought a number of orcs under the command
of a large orc who emerged from a tent near the gate.  Facing the party
was a fortress with a small watchtower.  Coming under arrow fire from the
tower, Axel scaled the tower's ladder and attack the archer, an orc ranger
called "Greytusk" by the other orcs.  With the help of the rest of the
party, he defeated Greytusk and her companions.

XP: 175 per character.

Items: Bronze key (found on the orc leader), +1 studded leather, bucket
of 90 arrows.  The orc leader also had two hachets and a +1 greatclub,
and Greytusk had a composite longbow; the party didn't pick up these
items.

Asa found a silver key and an invisibility potion in the sleeping
caves.  He also located a compartment in the orc leader's throne, but
couldn't get it open.

## Session 14 (2020-08-12) <a name="session14"></a>

The party scoured the orc caves for loot.  Asa managed to open the
compartment in the throne, and found coins, gems, several scrolls,
and a straw doll made to look like an elvish woman, with long
black humanoid hairs attached to its head.

The party regrouped on the roof of the watchtower, then proceeded into
the building through the hatch on the roof.  They left the tower floor
and entered the entrance hall, where they defeated two small bird-like
air elementals.  Moving on, they found a study and an ornate door which
led to Vilree's private chambers.  In here, they heard a lot of noise
from a small side room; Asa quietly closed and locked the door to this
room.  In the bedroom upstairs, the PCs found extensive personal notes.
Among them, Ezren found receipts corresponding to the reagents purchased
from Bort by Hallod (which the PCs found in <a href="#session2">session
2</a>), as well as a timeline of recent dates in Vilree's hand.  A note on
this sheet next to the date of Bort's murder read "Tied up loose end:
merchant".  A note next to yesterday's date read "The last reaction
is in place", and a final, undated entry read "Mother avenged".
The PCs also found sacks of money and several potions.

Downstairs and past the study, the PCs found a room containing only
a statue of a weeping elvish woman, surrounded by a churning pool of
water.  The PCs approached to examine the statue, and were attacked
by two water elementals which took the form of sharks.  The party
quickly defeated them.

XP: 190 per character

## Session 15 (2020-08-26) <a name="session15"></a>

The party returned to Vilree's chambers and investigated the kitchen.
Here they found a small flying homunculus which seemed to be trying to
cook.  It threw a pot of soup at Asa and tried to flee.  The party
destroyed it, but Ezren remembered that homonculi frequently have
telepathic links to their creators.

Moving back through the study and shrine room, they entered a long
laboratory room with several tables, a forge, and another statue of an
elven woman.  Here they encountered four large homonculus-like creatures
with elemental attacks.  They defeated them and explored the laboratory.

XP: 135 per character

Items: 6 lesser alchemist's fires, 4 lesser acid flasks, vial of
lesser stone body mutagen (drink to gain resistance 5 to physical
damage (except bludgeoning) for 1 hour.  Your speed is reduced by
10 feet and you take a -2 penalty to Ref saves during this time.).


## Session 16 (2020-09-02) <a name="session16"></a>

The party rested in Vilree's lounge, then returned to the laboratory.
They sent Asa down a spiral staircase to a lower level of the building.
He scouted the area and returned to the party.  They descended to a
short hallway.  Opening a wooden door at the end, they found another
larger, laboratory.  They defeated attacked two more of Vilree's
homunculus-like servants who were cleaning the laboratory; in the midst
of the fight, a large multi-limbed creature shambled into the room from
a northern chamber.  The PCs defeated the monsters and a small fire
elemental which attacked when they disturbed the lab's alchemical
preparations.  Exploring the laboratory, they found extensive notes
indicating that Vilree and her servants were preparing large amounts
of a poison called "viridian vapor".  Though they found a dwarven body
in a glass tube full of the poison, they could not find any other doses.
They also found a sketch of a flat-topped rock with a depression in the
top, along with designs for creating a reservoir in such a stone.  Ezren
recognized the stone as the Plaguestone in the center of Etran's Folly.
