    <h1>Larchfort</h1>

    <h3>by Wolfgang Corcoran-Mathe</h3>

    <p>The yard of the cobblestone guardhouse was strewn
    with chicken bones and old barrel-staves. It was at the edge of the
    city of Larchfort,
    pushed up against an eroded part of the city wall and guarding
    a gate used by farmers and poor merchants.</p>

    <p>A thin young man in guard’s livery stepped quickly out the front
    door. He blinked in the dawn light and rubbed his thin, fair beard
    nervously. His hair stuck out
    haphazardly from under his well-polished helmet. His uniform,
    clearly second-hand, was
    old but clean. He fidgeted with the rapier
    at his waist and looked back into the guardhouse.</p>

    <p>After a moment the other guards emerged. They were rough-looking
    men and women, mostly young, who joked and swore as
    they strode out into the cold morning air. A few had glazed eyes and
    red faces. One was still holding a gnawed mutton-leg, which he
    tossed aside as the guards lined up.</p>

    <p>Corporal Menwith was the last one out.
    He was a tall, barrel-chested man with a slack,
    jowly face and small eyes. He walked slowly down the line, inspecting
    the group with a bored air. The guards slouched against the fence as
    soon as he had passed.</p>

    <p>He came to the end of the line, humming to himself. Barely glancing
    at the young man, he turned and opened the gate.</p>

    <p>“Out we go,” he said, holding the gate open.
    The guards filed into the street. The corporal grabbed the young
    man’s shoulder as he walked past.</p>

    <p>“Did you think you’d get a bloody medal for being first out, eh
    Rysik?” he growled, holding the young man’s shoulder tightly.</p>

    <p>“No sir,” the young man said. “I thought I’d be timely
    today for the good of the whole house. Try to lift everyone’s
    spirits.” He nodded to the guards, who were loitering just
    outside the gate.</p>

    <p>Corporal Menwith looked disgusted.
    “You might raise someone’s spirits acting like a bloody fop, but
    it gives me a headache,” he said, scratching his ear beneath his
    dented helmet.</p>

    <p>“I, uh, heard there’ve been some complaints,” said Rysik.
    “Some are saying the guardhouse is a cesspit, that we’ve
    gotten slovenly. I was trying to help.”</p>

    <p>The corporal stared at Rysik for a moment. “’Help’,” he said
    sardonically. “You were trying to help!
    Our reputation’s been worrying you, has it? Trying to bring a
    little class into the outfit?” He spat at the
    ground next to the Rysik’s boots.</p>

    <p>“No!” cried the young man angrily.</p>

    <p>“You don’t fool me, Rysik,” the corporal said.
    “You think you’re too bloody good for us. You try to set yourself
    above your
    fellow guardsmen again and you’ll be sorry. Understood?”</p>

    <p>Rysik nodded, but his fist was clenched on the hilt of his blade.</p>

    <p>“Out,” growled Menwith. The young man saluted and marched through
    the gate.
    Menwith followed with a slow, rolling stride. “And no more nonsense
    on duty,” he said. “It’s latrine duty if you arrest any more vagrants
    or drunken farmers. Leave the merchants alone, too.”
    Rysik did not reply. He and the corporal joined the other guards,
    who then formed groups and set out on their appointed rounds.</p>

    <p>Although the sun was not yet fully up, the streets were
    busy. It was the third day in a week-long festival for the Baron’s
    birthday.
    Children in dirty linen were sweeping up the confetti and trash in the
    street. Several farmers were asleep against the wall of The Fish-Wife,
    the tavern
    across the street from the guardhouse, and one of the waiters was
    trying to awaken them by banging a pan with a wooden spoon.
    A group of people in rumpled, gaudy festival robes
    was gathered near the front door, laughing at the sleepy farmers.</p>

    <p>Rysik grimaced. He hated the ugly tavern and its drunken crowds.
    His bunk was on the
    first floor, and the singing and shouting last night had made
    it impossible to sleep. As he marched past the wide, squat,
    cheaply-whitewashed
    Fish-Wife, he cursed the place and wondered whether he’d be able
    to stay awake for the day’s 10-hour rounds.</p>

    <hr class="dinkus" />

    <p>Rysik returned to the guardhouse as the sun was setting. He got a
    plate of cold chicken from the kitchen and went to his bunk to eat.
    The barracks was empty. The other guards were either on duty or out
    enjoying the festival. The revelry in Millet Street was just beginning.
    Sitting on his straw mattress, Rysik watched the crowds arriving at
    the Fish-Wife from the window above his bunk.</p>

    <p>Although Rysik avoided the tavern, his eye was drawn to
    the women who paraded into it on busy evenings. Recently,
    he’d noticed a young woman with an erect posture who came early
    and seemed to keep to herself. Her hair was always neatly braided and
    she wore clean dresses. He wondered if he’d see her that
    evening. Rysik ate his dinner and waited, as the sun sank and the
    crowds in the street grew.</p>

    <p>It was night by the time she arrived, and the street was now
    bathed in flickering orange-red light from torches and lanterns.
    She was wearing a dark blue dress and ribbons, and seemed to be
    straggling behind a noisy group of women headed for the tavern.
    One of the women called out and beckoned
    to her, after which she disappeared inside.</p>

    <p>Still hungry after a day of tramping around the city, Rysik went
    back to the kitchen for a second helping. Then,
    exhaustion took him and he dozed in his bunk for nearly an hour.
    When he awoke, he returned to the window and saw the young woman in the blue dress
    standing under the eaves of the tavern, some distance from the crowded
    front door. She was wringing her hands.
    As Rysik watched, a heavy man
    stumbled out of the tavern and looked around, his red
    face shining in the torchlight. He strode toward the young woman,
    waving his hands and shouting. She turned and stepped quickly around
    the corner of the building into a narrow alley running along the
    side of the tavern. The man pursued, and the young woman
    darted into the dark alley. After a moment of searching, the red-faced
    man stamped off after her into the gloom.</p>

    <p>Rysik jumped out of the bunk and scrambled into his uniform. He grabbed his
    helmet and ran to the armory for a rapier, then out
    the door, the blade banging against his knee as he tried to buckle it
    to his waist.
    Two guards stationed in the yard looked up from their dice game to greet
    him. Ignoring them, he ran out of the gate into the crowd
    of revelers in the street.</p>

    <p>“Make way! City guard!” he yelled. His voice sounded thin in the uproar.
    People laughed and pointed. Only a few moved aside. It took him minutes
    of shoving and squeezing to cross the street. The alley smelled of
    stale ale and rancid food, and beyond the glow of the main street it was
    dark except for a single green paper lantern burning some twenty yards ahead.
    In the
    lantern light Rysik recognized the girl in the blue dress and her pursuer.
    The heavy man faced the girl, his back to Rysik. One of his hands was curled
    in a fist, while the other grasped the girl’s shoulder.</p>

    <p>Rysik ran toward the light, drawing his rapier. “City guard!” he
    shouted. “Hands off her!”</p>

    <p>The man turned and squinted at the approaching guard.
    His broad face was flushed and sweaty,
    with peevish, drunken eyes.
    Rysik noticed that the man’s cloth was expensive, though rumpled,
    and that his pointed shoes were trimmed with silver.</p>

    <p>“Go on,” he said with a laugh. “You a guard or a bandit,
    boy, sneaking up like that? I wasn’t harming
    the young lady. Clear off and leave us alone.” His eyes were sharp
    and his hand stayed on
    the young woman’s shoulder.</p>

    <p>“Hands off, I said.” Rysik’s hand trembled as he grabbed the man’s
    puffy red sleeve with his free hand.
    There was no-one else in sight, and this wealthy-looking
    man was likely armed. He tried to keep his voice level and stern.
    “Go home, sir. Leave the lady alone.”</p>

    <p>“Don’t touch me!” the man roared, shaking off Rysik’s hand. “Street
    scum is what you are. Envious, greedy urchin in a man’s uniform.”
    He stroked the girl’s hair. “Guard, my eye,”
    he said contemptuously. “I know what’ll fix you.” The man
    rummaged in his pockets and drew out something that gleamed.</p>

    <p>Rysik struck with the flat of his blade. Copper and silver coins showered
    on the dirt, and the man howled, rubbing his hand. The girl looked
    ready to bolt, but Rysik was between her and the well-lit
    street. She took a step to his right.</p>

    <p>“Hold!” said Rysik, more harshly than he intended. “Um, wait a moment,
    miss.” The girl stopped, glaring furiously at Rysik. Her
    anger disconcerted him.</p>

    <p>Muttering angrily, the heavy man bent to pick up his scattered money.
    He stuffed the coins into a pocket and shook his unbruised fist at
    Rysik. He was still rubbing his hand and tears were starting from
    his eyes.</p>

    <p>“You’ll be sorry for this,” he said. He looked at the young woman,
    who was again trying to edge
    away toward the street, then back at the young guard. His face
    twisted in rage.</p>

    <p>“The two of you!” he said. “A trap! A bloody trap! And to think
    I almost paid! Both of you! I’ll fix you up for this, my street
    rats.”</p>

    <p>Rysik stared icily at the man, taken aback.
    The blow to the man’s hand had raised a thick welt. Rysik wondered
    uneasily if this fat merchant could cause trouble.</p>

    <p>“Nothing of the sort, sir,” he said stiffly.
    “The festival gives you no license to
    molest a woman.”
    He turned to the girl. “Were you
    hurt, miss? Do you have a charge—”</p>

    <p>“No, of course not!” she cried. She turned away, wringing her hands.</p>

    <p>“D’ye see now, you lout?” shouted the man.</p>

    <p>“I see that I did well to interrupt when I did,” Rysik said weakly.
    “Since the lady appears unhurt
    and doesn’t wish to make a complaint, you may, um, go.”</p>

    <p>“A fool and a common thug, that’s what you are. Go off with your
    slut. You’ll hear about this, my boy.” The heavy man looked
    quickly around in the dirt for any missing
    coins, spat at Rysik’s feet, and strode off toward the
    street.</p>

    <p>As soon as he was gone, the girl turned on Rysik and shoved
    him forcefully in the shoulder. Rysik tripped backward. She was
    slightly taller than he was.</p>

    <p>“He’s right, you are a fool,” she said. “A cut-purse, too.
    I nearly made
    something of that before you came up and fouled things.
    I haven’t had a penny all evening.”</p>

    <p>Her voice was harsh with anger but had an educated accent.
    Her dress was patched and dusty, and
    her fine features were exaggerated by undernourishment.
    A loose lock of straight brown hair fell along her cheek.
    Her brown eyes were unfocused, from fatigue or perhaps drink.</p>

    <p>“I saw you run from him,” Rysik protested, “He was drunk and
    meant to harm you.”</p>

    <p>“He was nothing I couldn’t handle,” she said.
    “D’you think you’re the only one who carries a blade in case of
    trouble?” She patted her skirt pocket. “He was a boor, and as handsy
    and polite
    as the rest of the fine lads in there.” She gestured at
    the tavern. Her face was pained.</p>

    <p>Rysik nodded. “A rough place, to be sure.” He sheathed his blade
    and looked sheepish.</p>

    <p>Worry seemed to be consume the girl as she stared back at the tavern
    and the glowing street. “What’ll he do?” she said, more to herself
    than to Rysik. “Kellyn is a big customer, they
    told me. If he thinks I tried to catch him in a game and tells the
    keep, well …” Her anger returned and she turned back to Rysik.
    “What sort of a fool are you?
    I don’t believe a guard could be so stupid as to beat a man for talking
    to a—a whore, and then come out with nonsense like ‘the lady is
    unhurt’ like you were in the baron’s court. You’re some stable-boy or
    street actor who stole a uniform and went off clowning. I
    should take you to the guards and let them beat sense into you.”</p>

    <p>Annoyed, Rysik
    fished out his round bronze badge and offered it to her. She
    ignored it. “I have served as a guardsman of the Third Ward for
    six months and have been considered for distinction twice,” he
    said. This was an exaggeration: Corporal Menwith’s considerations
    had been purely sarcastic. “And I must warn you, Miss: meeting that
    drunkard back here, armed as you are, makes his charge sound more
    likely. Your work is legal, but …”</p>

    <p>“You’re a fool,” she repeated, and began to walk back
    toward the street. She seemed tired and preoccupied. She limped
    slightly; Rysik noticed that her right shoe had come apart and
    was bound together with string. His irritation vanished, and
    he regretted his reproof.</p>

    <p>“Can I, er, may I escort you to a safe place?” he said, following
    her.</p>

    <p>“Get away from me. Find another girl to insult.”</p>

    <p>“I meant no disrespect! Perhaps you came to the
    festival with your family?”</p>

    <p>“I have no family in Larchfort,” she replied and curtseyed sarcastically.
    “But my thanks for your kind offer, Sir Clown. I do hope you will
    excuse me and find your own way back to your circus tent. Good night!”
    She reached the street and turned, walking slowly to the tavern’s
    front door. Rysik watched the hem of her skirts disappear inside.</p>

    <p>He walked slowly back to the guardhouse. The revelers in the street
    laughed and pointed, and one threw his arm around Rysik and tried
    to get him to sing a song. Rysik freed himself, laughing weakly. He
    got back to the barracks, undressed, and crawled into his bunk. The
    party in the street roared on. He tossed and turned, and it was a long
    time before he fell asleep.</p>

    <hr class="dinkus" />

    <p>The festival continued for the next three days, during which Rysik
    saw nothing of the young woman. He did his rounds
    and came back exhausted and depressed to the guardhouse each evening.
    His mind
    constantly returned to the argument in the dark alley.</p>

    <p>On the day after the celebrations had ended, Rysik trudged back to
    the guardhouse through the trash-strewn streets. Corporal Menwith
    stood up as he walked in, and beckoned him into the armory. His
    big face was grey and his eyes were bloodshot from
    the previous night’s revelry. He sighed and pointed to a stool next to
    the grinding wheel. Rysik sat. Menwith sat down heavily in a stout
    oak chair across from him.</p>

    <p>“You’ve been busy, Rysik,” he said in a tired voice.
    “Got a complaint today from that silk merchant, Kellyn.
    Says you tried to game him during the festival, then beat him
    when he wouldn’t pay.”</p>

    <p>Rysik’s face felt hot. He scratched his beard. “It isn’t true,”
    he said.</p>

    <p>“’Course it isn’t true,” Menwith said. “It was more of your damned
    foolishness, I’d wager. But that doesn’t make an ounce of difference.
    He’s a rich man and has a lot of pull in the city. He wants you
    kicked into the street.”</p>

    <p>“But he’s a drunk and a lecher!” Rysik said, glaring at the
    corporal. “He
    was holding a woman against her will, and I did my duty. There
    were no other guards around to stop him, either—at least none
    that could hold a weapon.”</p>

    <p>“Watch your tongue,” growled Menwith. “I’m the only one between
    you and the street, so you’ll show some respect.
    Kellyn also says that woman was
    part of the game, that you two were going to split the takings after
    you nabbed him.” He sighed. “He’s
    going to make life difficult for her, too.”</p>

    <p>“Damn him,” said Rysik. “She did nothing wrong. I made a mistake,
    that’s all.”</p>

    <p>Menwith leaned back, looking up at the ceiling sardonically.
    “By the gods, he’s
    learning! That you did, and I told him
    you’ll be punished. Half pay and latrine duty
    for the next three months. Kellyn wasn’t pleased with that,
    but it’ll take him a bit to do more.” He stared at Rysik. “Go to
    a temple and pray sometime, boy. You made a powerful enemy,
    and you’ll need all the help you can get.” Menwith pushed
    himself up out of the chair. “Dismissed.”</p>

    <p>Rysik stood and saluted. “Thank you, sir.”</p>

    <p>Menwith nodded brusquely and went out.</p>

    <hr class="dinkus" />

    <p>It was another three days before he saw the young woman again. It
    was drizzly midday and she was sitting on the rim of a well, far from
    Millet Street. She was trying to keep dry under the
    well’s small pointed roof. Rysik recognized her dress as the blue
    one she’d worn on the festival evening last week, but it was now
    wet and muddy.</p>

    <p>He hailed her as he approached. She turned away
    when she saw him.</p>

    <p>“Miss!” he said, brushing the rain and mud-splatter off his
    face. “I—I meant to apologize.”</p>

    <p>“What for?” she said in a low, tired voice, looking
    at the muddy street.</p>

    <p>“Kellyn, the merchant,” Rysik said. “I made a mistake.
    He, uh, nearly got me
    kicked off the guards. I got to worrying that something had happened to
    you, when I didn’t see you near Millet Street after last week.”</p>

    <p>She laughed without mirth. “Something happened. I was barred from
    the Fish-Wife.”</p>

    <p>“Barred?” said Rysik. “Who told you?”</p>

    <p>“The keep, Jospur. Said I’d been gaming his customers. He would’ve
    barred you too if he’d known you, but it seems your lordship doesn’t
    frequent such vulgar places.”</p>

    <p>Rysik felt anger welling up.
    It was starting to rain in earnest,
    and his sodden helmet was weighing on him. He pulled it off and
    sat down on the rim, keeping his head under the roof.
    The hollow
    sound of the rain on the roof-boards echoed in the well.</p>

    <p>“And why should you?” he said. “It’s a filthy barn. I can’t imagine
    why you’d want to come within a mile of the place, let alone—
    That is, well—if you had a choice.” His anger subsided into
    miserable uncertainty.</p>

    <p>She nodded vaguely, still watching the street.
    A pair of old horses were
    plodding by in front of a cart spotted with lichen and newly
    covered with mud. The drivers huddled under damp, ragged cloaks.</p>

    <p>“I, er, hope you have someplace to go?” Rysik said.</p>

    <p>“One of the girls is lending me a cot,” she said. “The one who
    told me to try whoring. I don’t think that’ll last, though, if
    I can’t earn anything. She says I botched it at the Fish-Wife.”
    The girl smiled bitterly. “She says
    I meant to botch it. And she doesn’t know yet that I can’t go
    back. She only saw me leave early and she nearly took it out
    of my hide.”</p>

    <p>Rysik saw loneliness, fear, and a kind of miserable triumph in her
    eyes. He reached up uncertainly and placed his gloved hand on her
    shoulder. She batted it away without much energy.</p>

    <p>He chuckled bitterly. “Certainly the Fish-Wife is
    a fine place to spend your days. Certainly you wish to be an
    accomplished whore. As would anyone with brains and spirit.”</p>

    <p>Her look hardened and she crossed her arms. “More
    of your clowning.”</p>

    <p>Rysik cursed himself. “I’m sorry. But there must be something
    better.” He thought for a moment. “You told me you carried a
    blade. If you can fight, you’d make
    a guard that could beat most of the lot.
    Would you join the guard?”</p>

    <p>She nodded and her look softened a bit.
    “I can fight,” she said.
    She drew a thin-bladed dagger from her pocket and unsheathed it.
    The blade was pitted and tarnished. She rubbed it on her
    skirts, then put it away. “I had to learn when I was selling things on
    the streets.”</p>

    <p>“Very well.” Rysik stood up and put his helmet
    back on. The rain pattered on the boiled leather. “I’ll speak
    to Corporal Menwith tonight,” he said. “He’ll want to test you,
    and you’ll have to learn rapier and halberd. You’ll have to live
    with a bunch of drunken louts, but at least you won’t have to
    hang on any of them to earn your supper.” He smiled grimly.</p>

    <p>She grunted dismissively. “I can live with it, for a fire
    and regular meals.”</p>

    <p>Rysik nodded and began to walk off down the street.
    He turned back to the
    young woman, who was still sitting under the little roof with
    her arms crossed.</p>

    <p>“Who, er, should I name? To the corporal,” he said.</p>

    <p>She looked at him dully for a moment.</p>

    <p>“Lenyrl,” she said.</p>

    <p>“Lenyrl,” Rysik repeated. He trudged off through the mud. She had
    lost a chance at making a living through his mistake, he thought,
    and now he would find her another. He did the rest of his rounds
    hopefully, but with a trace of fear. His life in the guardhouse was
    barely tolerable; would it be any better for Lenyrl?</p>

    <hr class="dinkus" />

    <p>Rysik told Menwith about Lenyrl as soon as he returned. The
    corporal immediately refused to enlist her. Any friend of Rysik’s,
    he said, was bound to cause trouble for the guard. Rysik was moody
    during dinner, but his fortunes improved. After eating several large
    servings of mutton soup with roasted pumpkin and downing a small keg of
    ale, Menwith became gracious. He yielded, agreeing to test the
    young woman the following day.</p>

    <p>When he entered the barracks after dinner,
    the young guard was met with raucous cheers.
    By this time, the guards had heard of Rysik’s mishap with Lenyrl
    and Kellyn.
    Tally, a wide, muscular man with a patchy beard and wild
    eyes, grabbed Rysik around the shoulders and laughed in his
    face. His uniform was badly stained and he smelled of brandy,
    sweat, and old meat.</p>

    <p>“Rysik’s got himself a tart!” he shouted to the guards. There
    was another drunken cheer. Tally leered at Rysik. “You’re a naughty
    lad, though, using her as bait. That horny merchant fondles her and
    you let him go for a bit of coin, eh? No, you put her to better
    uses.” The guards roared and stamped their feet. Tally waggled his
    finger at Rysik theatrically. “Stay away from them old tricks, young
    lad. You might get yourself arrested.”</p>

    <p>Rysik smiled weakly and pulled away.
    Another guard, a tall man who had sat next to Rysik at table,
    clapped Tally around the shoulders and whispered
    in his ear. Tally’s wild eyes opened wide.</p>

    <p>“By the gods, Rysik’s got old Menwith to let his tart onto the
    guard!” He cackled. “Clever lad! Won’t that be a treat! I hope
    he don’t mind sharing. Drink, lad! Drink to our new tart, and
    to you what’s brought her to us.” Tally picked up a tankard and
    thrust it forward.</p>

    <p>Rysik’s face burned. He slapped the drink out of Tally’s hand
    and shoved the stout man out of his way, making for his bunk.
    The guards hooted.</p>

    <p>“Ooo, jealous!” Tally cried.</p>

    <p>The tall guard looked disgusted. “That fool should
    learn not to fall in love with whores. This house’ll go to hell
    if he behaves like that when she’s here.”</p>

    <p>Tally nodded. He strode over and leaned his, grinning bearded face over
    Rysik. “Once a
    whore, always a whore, Rysik!” he shouted. The other guards
    yelled in agreement, the women as much as the men.</p>

    <p>Rysik lay on his bunk and fumed.
    There was no point in trying to tell his
    fellow guards the truth, that Lenyrl had made only a failed attempt
    at prostitution
    and that he had been the agent of her failure.
    They would, of course, prefer their version.
    He thought of Lenyrl, and
    began to feel nauseous
    as he thought of how they’d described the young woman with her
    thin face and once-neat blue dress.
    Through
    his priggishness he had fixed her as low and squalid in the
    minds of the guards. There could be no life for her here. She
    could not be a guard; they would only accept her as a barracks
    whore.</p>

    <p>A guard in the upper bunk roared out in laughter and began to tell
    a joke at the top of his lungs. Rysik kicked the slats above him
    with both boots, and his neighbor responded by throwing his own
    boot at Rysik’s head. It struck him in the face. Tears welled up,
    and Rysik hid his face in his pillow.</p>

    <p>He had to apologize, he thought, if nothing else. And he would
    still try to help her, if he could.</p>

    <hr class="dinkus" />

    <p>The next day he made excuses to the hungover Menwith. The corporal
    had forgotten that he’d agreed to test Lenyrl, and was more
    confused than annoyed. Rysik saw Lenyrl during his rounds, and told
    her stonily that he could not get her a place on the guard. She shrugged
    and said nothing.</p>

    <p>As he walked, Rysik grimly resolved to try to persuade Jospur,
    the keeper of the Fish-Wife, to let Lenyrl back in. He hated the
    idea.</p>

    <p>When he got back to Millet Street it was nearly sundown, though
    nothing of the sun could be seen through the gray mass of clouds
    gathered over Larchfort. The rain had come and gone as Rysik walked
    his rounds, and he was now thoroughly damp and mud-spattered.
    Under the eaves of the Fish-Wife, he dumped small rocks from his
    wet boots and tried to clean his grimy beard with some trough
    water. This done, he went into the tavern.</p>

    <p>The Fish-Wife was quiet, with only a few workers sitting at the
    long, dark tables. The big rectangular room smelled of tallow
    and stale ale.
    It was a dingy, battered box, poorly disguised by
    faded tapestries and banners.
    A boy in an apron was scattering new straw
    on the floors, taking occasional sips from a cup
    which he held in his left hand.
    Bengt Jospur was standing near the bar, arguing
    with a man in a leather cap who was towing a cart of flour sacks.
    The portly, full-bearded owner glanced at Rysik when the young
    guard came in. He returned Rysik’s
    greeting with a hand raised against interruption.</p>

    <p>Stifled for the moment, Rysik ordered small beer, cheese, and bread from
    the straw-boy. The bread was coarse and black and the cheese
    old, but Rysik was hungry. After a few minutes, the provisioner
    unloaded his goods and left, grumbling. Jospur
    sat on the stool next to Rysik and peered at him with watery
    brown eyes.</p>

    <p>“Evening, guardsman,” he said in a low, rough voice. “Fare
    satisfactory, I hope?”</p>

    <p>Rysik swallowed and tried to sit up. He would have to make his
    case quickly. Behind his solicitous manner, Jospur was impatient.</p>

    <p>“A woman has been barred from this place, sir,” he said. “A young woman,
    named Lenyrl, who came here during the festival. I’ve come to request
    that she be allowed to return.”</p>

    <p>Jospur thought for a moment. “Lenyrl. Pale girl, braids,
    blue dress with patches? She came in with the other girls last week.”</p>

    <p>Rysik nodded.</p>

    <p>Jospur’s face hardened. “No. By the gods, she’s a thief. Kellyn
    the silk merchant, one of the biggest men around here, said she
    meant to bleed him. She sat right here and told me she was some
    kind of whore-in-training, but I know her type. Sharp, and good
    with a blade, maybe.”</p>

    <p>“Sharp but honest, sir,” said Rysik. “Kellyn tried to force
    himself on her. Can you not see that he
    means to hide his disgrace, and revenge himself on this girl?”</p>

    <p>“That’s as may be,” Jospur said.
    “What’s your word against his? I’ve never seen
    you before, and I’ve heard nothing from the guards about this before
    today.” He rubbed his small, red nose and went on.
    “Kellyn told me a
    bit more. Said that this Lenyrl had a friend in the guards who came
    up on him while he was talking with her. The fellow beat him, then
    went off with the girl. Sort of a trap, you know?”</p>

    <p>Rysik shifted uneasily and said nothing.</p>

    <p>Jospur continued. “Kellyn didn’t know this guard, but, from
    his description, you ain’t far from the mark.”</p>

    <p>Rysik argued with himself for a moment before he replied.
    It was likely that Jospur was playing with him; if not, the truth
    would come out eventually. “I was that guard,” he said,
    evenly. “I struck Kellyn once, because he wouldn’t release the
    woman. It was rash, and I’ve been punished. But the rest of his
    story’s a lie.”</p>

    <p>“Maybe, maybe.” Jospur shrugged, beginning to look bored.</p>

    <p>“The young woman must be allowed back, even if I am not,” Rysik
    went on. “Her living depends on it. You have my word that she’ll
    pursue it honestly.”</p>

    <p>“Maybe,” Jospur said again. “It ain’t worth my time to find
    out. All I know is Kellyn’s a good customer and I ain’t crossing
    him, not for a street rat and a boy guard.”
    He grunted as he stood up.
    “No, lad, she’ll not be back. As for you, you’ll stay
    away from Kellyn if you know what’s good for you. I can’t bar the
    guard, but I won’t have you driving away business.”</p>

    <p>Jospur gave a curt nod and walked off.</p>

    <p>Rysik ate the rest of his meal in silence.
    He could think of no way of changing Jospur’s
    mind. The man wasn’t interested in the facts. It was easier
    for him to bar Lenyrl and forget about it. Rysik’s fist clenched as
    he watched the
    man stride about the tavern, ordering his staff here and there
    and rubbing boot marks from the benches. Lenyrl, he thought, should
    not have to depend on this lout’s good opinion for her living. Furious,
    Rysik dropped some coins on the bar and walked out.</p>

    <hr class="dinkus" />

    <p>Rysik met Lenyrl by the well again the next day. He told her about his
    meeting with Jospur, then suggested other jobs—at
    a jeweler’s shop near Millet Street, or …
    She shrugged and thanked him quietly. He didn’t see her again
    that week.</p>

    <p>He became despondent over his failure to help Lenyrl. Though the guards
    had forgotten about Lenyrl and no longer teased him at every opportunity,
    the guardhouse had become intolerable.
    Rysik ate little, and began to wander
    around the
    city in the evenings, coming back to the barracks just before
    curfew to scrub the latrine.
    He dozed through
    his appointed rounds. When Menwith threatened him with dismissal, Rysik
    shrugged and promised to do better, with little conviction.</p>

    <p>One night he walked
    to the cobbled, sloping streets of the high town, where the sound
    of his steps
    echoed off the tall, dark houses and stout fortifications. His path
    wound around and around the district, which was deserted
    except for the occasional beggar or wanderer. He
    imagined Lenyrl walking the same path, just out of sight beyond
    the next bend.</p>

    <p>The moon
    rose as the bells rang in their somber tower, and Rysik looked out
    over the silent city from the top of a steep road. He saw a maze
    of shadowed wood and stone, encircled far off by the city wall.
    The rolling land beyond seemed impossibly distant.
    The streets of Larchfort trapped him, and would, he
    thought, hold him and Lenyrl for the rest of their lives.</p>

    <p>It was dawn when he finally made it back to Millet Street.
    Rysik’s heart sank when he saw an armed figure in a heavy
    cloak waiting
    near the door. He had hoped that his return would be unnoticed,
    and now prepared himself for a tongue-lashing.</p>

    <p>The figure waved to him. It was Lenyrl. She was wearing
    a leather breastplate and an old-fashioned helmet.
    Her dagger was in her belt, and she wore muddy traveling boots
    over ragged wool stockings.</p>

    <p>“I was about to give up and leave,” she whispered as he came
    into the yard. “Where were you?”</p>

    <p>Rysik was speechless for a moment. “In the high town,” he
    said, more loudly than he’d meant to. She put her finger to her
    lips. “I … why are you here?”</p>

    <p>“I need a sword,” she said. She tapped her dagger. “This was
    enough for Larchfort, but I’m done with this rubbish heap.”
    She looked at Rysik, and a grin broke across her face. “Sir
    Clown,” she said, “do me the honor of nicking me a blade?”</p>

    <p>“A sword?” he said.</p>

    <p>She punched his shoulder with her mittened hand. “Yes! Now,
    before they’re awake!”</p>

    <p>Rysik did as she asked. He took a short sword that
    had hung in the armory for as long as he’d been a guard, then
    went to the kitchen. He wrapped some leftover food in a
    cloth and returned to the yard. There was no sound from the barracks.</p>

    <p>Lenyrl thanked him quickly and buckled the sword to her belt. She
    wrapped the thick wool cloak around her, concealing the
    weapons.</p>

    <p>“Where will you go?” asked Rysik.</p>

    <p>“Somewhere better,” Lenyrl said. “I’ll follow the merchant route
    out of town. I can do mercenary work. Maybe I’ll look for my family.”</p>

    <p>“Mercenary work? I can’t imagine why—” For a moment Rysik looked
    scandalized; then he sighed and nodded. “I understand.
    Please be careful.”</p>

    <p>“Yes, your lordship,” she said, scowling and putting the food in a small
    quilted bag. “Thanks for the grub. Maybe you ought to leave, too,
    when you’re done trying to act like a lord in a pig sty.”</p>

    <p>Rysik thought of the raucous barracks and the
    red-eyed guards, and felt a powerful longing to leave now and
    be rid of them. He stared into Lenyrl’s pale face, which now looked
    confident and stronger than anything he felt within him.</p>

    <p>“I couldn’t,” he said sadly. “I’ve made a mess of things here, and
    I’d do as much on the road or in some other town. You’re right,
    I’ve been playing at being a lord when—”</p>

    <p>“Forget it,” she said. “You did your best, you know. Crying about
    it is worse than doing nothing.” She shrugged, and
    Rysik saw disappointment in her eyes.</p>

    <p>“Well then, I’m off,” she said. She went out of the yard, gave Rysik
    a brief wave, and set off down Millet Street toward the city gate,
    her cloak flapping in the breeze.</p>

    <p>Rysik watched her pass through the gate, then stood in the yard
    rubbing his tired eyes and watching the sun rise above the wall.
    After a while, he went inside,
    where a few guards were now stirring. Rysik drew a mug
    of small beer and sat at the long table by himself, deep in thought.
    After a few minutes the guards filed in, and the room was filled with
    the smell of sweat and bacon fat. They ate and went
    off to the armory. Soon came Menwith’s mustering call, and the
    hall was full of the sound of hobnailed boots and clanking arms.
    Rysik continued to sip at his cup and think of Lenyrl’s cloaked
    figure
    disappearing down the road.</p>

    <p>When he finally stood and prepared to leave, he had made a
    decision. As she had seen the way out and taken it, so would he. He
    would find something better than his dull rounds and the sordid
    dealings of Larchfort. He would follow Lenyrl; if not today,
    then soon.</p>
